            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The greateſt Monarch

               </gap>rs, haraſs'd and oppreſt by that dreadful Monſter <hi>War,</hi> that great Boar of the Foreſt, which makes deſolate Cities and Provinces, ſo that their Sleep is not broke by the unſeaſonable ſound of Trumpets, and the rattling of Drums, nor are they fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of their Houſes (I had almoſt ſaid, out of their Wits) by the ſudden Infalls and Attacks of a fierce Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; they have good reaſon to bleſs and praiſe the God of Peace for ſo great a happineſs, and with a thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, pray for his Vicegerent, the King, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derr whoſe auſpicious raign they enjoy theſe <hi>Halcyon</hi> days, and under whoſe Government, if they cannot ſit under their own Fig-trees and Vines, at leaſt they may eat the Fruit of the one, and drink the Juice of the other in Peace and Quiet. Yet let them remember, that War follows Peace, as naturally as Night does follow Day; and that after a ſweet calm, a dreadful ſtorm is to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, againſt which the wary Pilot carefully provides. If you think I do hereby invite all Gallant Spirits in time of Peace, to provide themſelves for War, you are not at all deceiv'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I do indeed deſire, that when War comes unexpectedly (as often it does) it may not find brave men ſurpriz'd, and to need inſtruction in thoſe neceſſary
<pb facs="tcp:97406:5"/> Military things, which they might have learn'd before at full leiſure.</p>
            <p>If you be one of thoſe, who either already knows, or imagines you do know all the rules of the Ancient and Modern Art of War; Or if you be one of thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know neither of them, I ſhall adviſe you, to ſave your ſelf the Money to buy, and the trouble to read this trifle of mine. It is with none of you that it ſeeks acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it walks in another Stage. It is to you, Young Lords and Gentlemen, it makes its humble addreſs; It is to you, Generous Souls, that it offers its ſervice: And it is from you (whoſe birth entitles you to Martial Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes) that it expects a fair welcome and entertainment. Moſt, or many of you will not learn theſe Peaceable Arts and Sciences, without which no Principality or Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick can well or long ſubſiſt; and all of you cannot be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Stern of Government, or permitted to ſit at the Kings Council-board: It will be therefore for you to conſider, how you can ſerve your Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey but by Arms. The ancienteſt of you all derive your Pedegree from thoſe who bore Arms, It is by Arms you had your Honour, and it is by Arms you are bound now to maintain it. I ſhall not bid you look to thoſe of your own rank and quality in <hi>France,</hi> who glory to learn the Military Art from them, and yet their example deſerves imitation; but I ſhall entreat you to follow the footſteps of your Martial Anceſtors, and account it more honour for you by Warlike Exploits to ſhew you are their Worthy Succeſſors, than to pretend to it only by a vain muſter of their old Charters, Patents, and Commiſſions. If this prevail not with you, then ſet before your eyes, but at a very great diſtance, the Moſt Illuſtrious Prince <hi>James,</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> and <hi>York;</hi> no mortal can boaſt of a higher Birth and Extraction, yet that did not hinder him in his younger years to learn the true Art to fight Battels both at Sea and Land, which hath made him now ſo famous all the World over. Nor do I deſire you to reſt ſatisfied when you know indifferently well to exerciſe Companies, Troops or Regiments of Horſe and Foot, though that be both good and neceſſary; let there be a <hi>plus ultra</hi> with you, and endeavour to know all that belongs to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Souldier; for you are indeed the ſtock out of which
<pb facs="tcp:97406:5"/> our Soveraign ſhould chuſe his Military Commanders, and then there will be the leſs need of ſuch perſons as I am, whom the World nick-names <hi>Souldiers of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</hi> Remember it is not your Native Courage and Valour (though that be an eſſential part) though eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you were as ſtout as ever <hi>Hector</hi> was ſaid to be, that will ſerve your turn; it is knowledge in Martial affairs that you are to learn; and though the Art of War be a Practical one, yet the Theory is ſo needful, that without it you may be Common Souldiers good enough, but not good Commanders; you are to know more than you daily ſee; for it is a ſign of a very mean Officer, when he tells you he likes not ſuch a thing, becauſe he never ſaw it before. I wiſh with all my heart, that this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Treatiſe may afford you ſome help to ſo noble a Study: In it I give you few, or rather no rules of my own, I am not ſo vain; but I go very far back to ſearch for them in all the remains of Antiquity: And let it not offend you, that I illuſtrate Rules and Cuſtomes of War by ſeveral Inſtances; I do it purpoſely becauſe the Nature of Man is rather led by Example, than driven by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept: <hi>This</hi> ſeems to impoſe, <hi>that</hi> only to invite to a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Emulation: Beſides, the right or wrong doing of an action, with all its circumſtances, is better clear'd by the firſt, than by the laſt. And if I ſeem to claſh with the old Maſters, or new Tacticks of the Ancient or Modern Art of War, I give my Reaſons for it, which you may either approve or diſapprove as you pleaſe, without doing me the leaſt injury. When I tell my own opinion of Military Cuſtomes, looking back as far as I could find any glimmering light of Hiſtory to direct me; I give alſo my Reaſons, which you may likewiſe reject if you pleaſe, for by ſo doing I ſhall neither be condemn'd for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie nor Schiſm.</p>
            <p>If any Gentlemans curioſity leads him to enquire, Why I Print this Book? I ſhall Anſwer him firſt, I can ſincerely aſſure him, Vanity to make my ſelf known in the World puſh'd me not to it, elſe I had not let it lye unprinted by me ten whole Years after firſt I wrote it. Next, very few could importune me to publiſh it, ſince very few did know I had writ it. Nor did I, indeed, make it publick to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuſe ſome gay men, by letting them ſee they knew no
<pb facs="tcp:97406:6"/> more than their Neighbours; and yet the doing ſo had been Charity, if my offer had been receiv'd as kindly as I intended it. The conſideration that induced me to it was in ſhort this, When I had ended all I had reſolv'd to ſay of the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Art of War, and durſt not hazzard on the vaſt Ocean of the Modern Art, I was encourag'd to proceed to that, and to bring all I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, to as great perfection as I could, by a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and good Judge in thoſe affairs: And when I had done ſo, that Noble Perſon, after my concealment of it ſome years, deſir'd to peruſe it; and as he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded me to finiſh, ſo he prevail'd with me to publiſh theſe Eſſays: But be pleas'd to know, he was ſuch a one as his Majeſty had made choice of in the year 1666. to command his <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Army, towards the end whereof he routed the Rebels at <hi>Pentland:</hi> The very ſame Perſon was again entruſted by his Majeſty, with the conduct of his Forces, in the year 1679. and continues ſtill in that Command, and is well enough known by the Name of General <hi>Dalyell.</hi> But I am afraid you may ask me, What mov'd me to begin to write theſe Diſcourſes? But for that, if I were put to the Rack till I give you my Reaſon, I could give no other than this, That being out of employment, and not accuſtom'd to an idle life, I knew not how to paſs away my ſolitary and retired hours with a more harmleſs divertiſement.</p>

The terrible Ware which our Paſſions raiſe within our Breaſts againſt our Reaſon, make us cry to Heaven for that inward Peace, whereof neither Man nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil can bereave us. Even ſo, thoſe people, among whom<note place="margin">Peace a choice Bleſſing.</note> the ſeat of War is, ſend up their frequent Petitions to the God of Peace, to remove that dreadful Scourge from them; but the pity is, when their Prayers are heard, and that they have obtain'd (the ſo much deſir'd and long'd for Peace, few or none of them ſtudy to preſerve ſo ineſtimable a Jewel.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97406:12"/> Many Nations have, and do this day enjoy a quiet Peace, but ſeldome or never had the whole habitable World a general Ceſſation of Arms, but when <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſhut the Temple of <hi>Janus:</hi> And it was fit that it ſhould be ſo then, when the Prince of Peace was to deſcend from the Manſions of Peace, to enter the Womb of the Immaculate Virgin.

I believe, if the Prophet <hi>Gad</hi> had ſpoke nothing of Peſtilence, but given <hi>David</hi> his choice of War or Famine, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> had undoubtedly choſen the laſt, as the leſs Plague. For, though all the three be from God; (for there is no evil in the City which is not from the Lord) yet War is but mediately from God, and immediately from Man: And the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> choſe rather to fall into Gods hands than Mans. Beſides, both Peſtilence and Famine have been, and undoubtedly will be, in the World without War; but it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that War can be of any continuance in a Land, but it will draw after it both Peſtilence and Famine, as its inſeparable concomitants.

This ſort of War ſends Coblers and other Mechanicks to the Pulpits, to torture their Audience with Non-ſence. This converts Souldiers into Preachers, who by vertue of their double cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, belch out Blaſphemies againſt the great God of Heaven, and rebellious and opprobrious Speeches againſt his Vice-gerents on Earth. And on the other hand, this War metamorphoſeth Preachers into Souldiers, and tells them, that a Corſlet becomes them better than a Canonical Coat, and a broad Sword better than a long Gown: It whiſpers them in the ear, that Chriſt would not have bid thoſe of his Diſciples who had two Coats, ſell one of them, and buy a Sword, if he had not intended to leave War as a Legacy to his followers, as well as Peace. It tells them, they ought in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to ſummon Subjects under the pain of eternal damnation, to riſe in Arms againſt the Soveraign Power, becauſe they are bidden <hi>Curſe</hi> Meroz, <hi>who would not come out to help the Lord againſt the Mighty:</hi> Yet very few of them can tell you, whether <hi>Meroz</hi> was a Prince, a City, or a Countrey. But I dwell too long here.</p>
                  <p>Not long after the Flood we find numerous Armies raiſed by <hi>Nimrod</hi> and his ambitious Succeſſors, to ſubject others of <hi>Noah</hi>'s race to their lawleſs do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion: And indeed, if the Stories of theſe very ancient times be true (as they are very much to be doubted) we read not of ſo great Armies (except ſome in Holy Writ) as thoſe, which <hi>Ninus,</hi> and the famous <hi>Semiramis,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>India,</hi> whom ſhe invaded, brought together. It is pity we ſhould not know how they were armed, and in what order they fought: I ſuppoſe there were Wars in the World, before there was any to record them. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> wrote in Hieroglyphicks, and therefore, I believe, next to <hi>Moſes,</hi> we are obliged to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> for giving us a glimpſe of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And truly, even they wrote the occaſions, the cauſes, the beginnings, the progreſs, and iſſues of Wars ſo confuſedly, and fabulouſly, that we can<note place="margin">Ancient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</note> build but little on their relations, till themſelves became renown'd by the ſtout reſiſtance they made againſt the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy; and yet even then, they give us but little light, how other Nations, beſides themſelves, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd the War, what Art or Order they uſed in their Battels, or how their Combatants were Armed.</p>
                  <p>The Sacred Story mentions no Battel fought after the Flood, or before it, till that of <hi>Chaderlaomer,</hi> and other three Kings, againſt the five Kings of the Plain. But we may preſume, there were many bloody bickerings before that, when <hi>Nimrod, Belus, Ninus</hi> and <hi>Semiramis</hi> (if <hi>Ninus</hi> was not <hi>Amraphel</hi> one of the four Kings, whereof I much doubt) impos'd the yoke of Slavery on ſo many Nations. In this Battel fought in the plain of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:97406:13"/> the five Kings were beaten, but how either they or their Adverſaries fought, with<note place="margin">The Battel of <hi>Sodom.</hi>
                     </note> what Arms, or in what Order, the Hiſtory tells us nothing. The Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours carry away a great booty, and many Priſoners, and among them <hi>Lot,</hi> and the endeavouring his reſcue, made the War juſt on his Uncle <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſide: He follows, and overthrows the four Kings, and brings back all the Goods and Priſoners. <hi>Abraham</hi> had no particular Warrant for this War, but it was approved, for thereafter <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> the Prieſt of the moſt High God, bleſſed him; nor was it needful for the Father of the Faithful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the War, becauſe he look'd upon himſelf there, as an Ally, if not a Subject of ſome of the five Kings, particularly him of <hi>Sodom.</hi> The Text makes this action of <hi>Abraham</hi> a ſurprizal; for it is ſaid, he ſmote them in the night. We find he Armed three hundred and eighteen of his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but with what kind of Arms, either for Offence or Defence, we know not; and yet it would ſeem, his Servants had learned to handle their Arms, for ſome of our Tranſlations have it, He armed his train'd Servants. By this place of Scripture, it appears that theſe Kings had fought together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe it is ſaid, the five Kings rebell'd againſt <hi>Chaderlaomer,</hi> whom they had ſerv'd twelve years; now it is more than probable, they had fought at leaſt once with him, before they offer'd to do homage to him, but <hi>Moſes</hi> mentions not that, as not being to his purpoſe, his deſign there being only to give us the Story of <hi>Abraham.</hi>

                     <hi>Egyptians</hi> were well armed, and knew the Art of War; and that <hi>Joſhua</hi> and other Captains of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> might have learned from them the contemplative part of their Military skill, which afterward they practis'd on thoſe Nations they were ordain'd to root out. And if the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> had War with the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> while the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were under them, I make no doubt, but many of them ſerv'd in theſe Wars. <hi>Xenophon</hi> commends very much both the valour and the skill of thoſe <hi>Egyptians</hi> who were with <hi>Croe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> at that Battel which he fought with <hi>Cyrus:</hi> And it is very like that the <hi>Grecians</hi> themſelves got the rudiments of their Art of War in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as well as of other liberal Sciences; and it is like, <hi>Lycurgus</hi> taught the Rules of the<note place="margin">So were the <hi>Spartans.</hi>

                  <p>TO find out the Arms, or Art of War of theſe Ancient Nations, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> till the <hi>Grecians</hi> wrote their own actions, we have very little light. To begin with the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> In the foregoing Chapter I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that their great Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> fought with four Kings and routed them; he was, no doubt, the firſt, but not the laſt of the race of <hi>Heber,</hi> who fought a Battel. I told you alſo, it is not known how he armed his ſervants and followers. That all or ſome of them had Swords, is no more but a probable<note place="margin">Sword<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> conjecture, for we do not read of that Weapon in Scripture or any other Book, till <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> (who were <hi>Abrahams</hi> great Grand-children) co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97406:13"/> their cruel revenge with the cloak of Religion, (of ſo old a date is that miſchievous practice) deſtroy'd the <hi>Sechemites</hi> with Swords; for it is ſaid, Each man took his Sword.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had Arms, wherewith they fought againſt <hi>Sihon</hi> and <hi>Og,</hi> and other people, is not at all to be doubted: In the Wilderneſs they could not get them; and therefore, I think, that they brought them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with them, ſhould be no queſtion; but how they came by them, to me is a very great queſtion. For I think it not at all probable, that thoſe Kings or thoſe <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs,</hi> who ſo grievouſly oppreſs'd them, would ſuffer ſo many hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of them to be arm'd, no more, than afterwards the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> when they had the upper hand, would ſuffer a Smith to dwell in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For my part, I believe, at their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they borrow'd all manner of Arms from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as well as they did better movables, for they had alike right to all.</p>
                  <p>But what kind of Arms they uſed, when they fought with thoſe Nations whom they extirpated, what Art or Order they uſed in their Marches and Battels, both before and after they came to the Land of Promiſe, we are yet to learn: yet we find mention'd, for the Offenſive, Swords, Javelins, and<note place="margin">Arms of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
                     </note> Spears; and for the Defenſive, Targets and Shields (I ſuppoſe Head pieces could not be wanting) are recorded to have been in the Magazines of their ſeveral Kings; nor did they want their great Artillery of Baliſts, and Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pults, as ſhall be declared in its proper place. Yet, if all the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> according to their ſeveral Statures, were proportionably arm'd as their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion <hi>Goliah</hi> was, and all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> as well arm'd as their Neighbours the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> we may ſafely conclude, they were as well arm'd every jot, as the <hi>Grecia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s</hi> or <hi>Macedonians</hi> were afterwards. We find likewiſe they had Chariots; but how many, or how arm'd or order'd, we know not. We may alſo probably conjecture, their Files were ten deep, when they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall'd their Batallions, for I find they had Companies and Regiments much<note place="margin">Their Order.</note> about the number of thoſe of our lateſt modern Wars: for we read of Captains of thouſands, who were ſuch as our Colonels; Captains of hundreds, who were Centurions, and like our private Captains; Captains of fifties, ſuch as our Lieutenants. It is pity, <hi>Joſephus</hi> (who was a great Captain himſelf) did not tranſmit the Military Art of his Countrey-men to poſterity, it had been worth his labour.</p>
                  <p>As little, or indeed leſs light doth any Author afford us to know the Arms, Order, and Diſcipline of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> to whom the firſt Monarchy is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,<note place="margin">Aſſyrians.</note> by the univerſal conſent of Hiſtory. But we find, that not only they, but the <hi>Perſians, Indians,</hi> and other Nations uſed Elephants and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots.</p>
                  <p>The Elephant of <hi>India</hi> is ſaid to be a far more couragious Beaſt than that of <hi>Africk:</hi> They are yet made uſe of in the Wars of that Countrey. Of old they carried wooden Towers on their backs, wherein were lodged armed men, who threw Darts and Javelins among the bands of the enemies, through which theſe dreadful Creatures were furiouſly driven, who of themſelves were ſufficiently able to break the ſtrongeſt and beſt compos'd Squadrons of armed men: But when they were gall'd and wounded, and turned head, then<note place="margin">The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants.</note> they did that miſchief to their Maſters, that was intended for the Enemy. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> before their Wars in <hi>Greece,</hi> made no uſe of them; and though at firſt <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> terrified them with the ſight of theſe, indeed, terrible Beaſts; yet thereafter they found means to wound them, or by making lanes and ſtreets for them, to render their fury ſo uſeleſs, that they got but little hurt by them. But for all this, I cannot have faith enough to believe what <hi>Livy</hi> reports, that an armed Souldier enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to combat with an Elephant, and that the Beaſt grapled him with his Trunk about the middle, and caſt him up in the air, but that the Souldier falling with little or no hurt, wounded the Beaſt with his Sword. I ſhould be of opinion, that ſuch a hug as that might have cruſh'd both the Souldiers Corſſet and his Bones, till the Marrow came out; for in his Trunk (which the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> call <hi>Proboſcis</hi>) there is ſuch ſtrength, that therewith, as ſome write, he is able to fell Trees; or I think, the Elephant might have toſs'd his Duelliſt ſo high in the air, that the very fall ſhould have daſh'd him in pieces. But <hi>Livy</hi> did no more ſee this Romantick combat, than he ſaw ſhowers of Blood
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97406:14"/> and Stones, which he writes rain'd frequently among the Territories of the <hi>Romans</hi> and their Allies.</p>
                  <p>Chariots in ancient times had ſometimes Scythes on both ſides of them, ſometimes none. <hi>Xenophon</hi> writes that before <hi>Cyrus</hi> time, the <hi>Trojans</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and thereafter the <hi>Cyrenians</hi> uſed Chariots drawn with four Horſes, in every one whereof was only one Combatant, and a Driver or Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.<note place="margin">Chariots.</note> This faſhion ſeem'd to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> of no greater advantage than to skirmiſh a little, but did not at all help to beat an Enemy rang'd in Battel: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he aboliſh'd it, and order'd his Chariots to be made with ſtrong and broad Axle-trees, to both ſides of which were faſten'd Braſs or Iron Scythes; next he put armed men within the Chariots, who in the charge diſcharg'd luſtily their miſſile Weapons, wherewith he took care that they ſhould be well ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with theſe he did not only ſometimes skirmiſh, but for moſt part charg'd furiouſly the Enemies ſtrongeſt and cloſeſt Bodies and Batallions.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Egyptians</hi> Arms for the Offenſive, were great and maſſy Spears, ſaith<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Egyptian</hi> Arms.</note> 
                     <hi>Xenophon,</hi> but how long they were, he doth not tell; and for the Defenſive, they had Shields of Braſs, of ſuch a largeneſs, that therewith they cover'd both their Bodies and their Legs. They marſhall'd their men one hundred in File, and when this was told to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> he made himſelf merry with it, and ſaid, he wiſh'd all his Enemies would draw up a thouſand deep, for ſo they ſhould be the more eaſily ſurrounded, their flanks ſooner attack'd, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, ſaid he, I ſhould have the cheaper market of them. By what that ſame Author ſaith, it would ſeem, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> drew up conſtantly an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred deep; for when <hi>Croeſus</hi> deſir'd them to change, they anſwered, They<note place="margin">Their Order.</note> would not alter their Countrey faſhion. Yet I conjecture, the <hi>Egyptian</hi> cuſtome hath been to marſhal their Batallions by the ſqua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> root, for here I find their Body conſiſted of ten thouſand men, and they perhaps being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to make a ſquare of men, (which is to have as many in File as Rank) have embattell'd them, a hundred in each; for a hundred times a hundred produceth ten thouſand. Of the Square Root I ſhall ſpeak hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> that ſerv'd on Foot in <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s time carried for the Defenſive,<note place="margin">Arms of the ancient <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                     </note> a Head-piece, Corſlet, and a little Target; and for the Offenſive, a Sword and a Curtle-axe, beſides their Darts and Stones. His Cuiraſſiers and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe were arm'd as the <hi>Grecians</hi> were, whereof I ſhall ſpeak in the next Chapter. In his time, the <hi>Sacans</hi> and <hi>Carduſians,</hi> a people dwelling near <hi>Perſia,</hi> were excellent Bow-men on Horſe-back, whoſe off-ſpring, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, were thoſe <hi>Parthians,</hi> who by their valour and skill in that manner of fight, routed the Army of the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul <hi>Craſſus,</hi> and kill'd himſelf; and put <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> to ſo ſhameful a retreat, and ſo near a danger of evident ruine, that oftner than once he offer'd to rid himſelf of that impending diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace by Self-Murther, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Life relates. <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who was the firſt <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch, did not adhere to one conſtant number of Ranks; for ſometimes he drew up his Batallions ten in File; and it is like, he obſerv'd<note place="margin">Their Order.</note> that moſt, for he had Myriarchs, who had the command of ten thouſand; Chiliarchs, who were Colonels of thouſands; and Centeniers, who were Captains of hundreds; all which may infer ten deep. Yet in <hi>Xenophons</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Book, we find <hi>Cyrus</hi> his <hi>Perſians</hi> to be twelve in File; and his Batal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, when he fought with <hi>Croeſus,</hi> were four and twenty deep; and indeed that was deep enough: Perhaps in the marſhalling his ſeveral Bodies, he hath ſometimes made uſe of the Square Root: But the King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> in that<note place="margin">Lydians.</note> ſame Battel which he fought with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> made both his Horſe and Foot thirty deep, except the <hi>Egyptians</hi> I ſpoke of, who were an hundred in File, as I told you formerly. What more I have to ſay of any point of War uſed by any other ancient Nation, either before, or in the time of either the <hi>Grecian</hi> or the <hi>Roman</hi> greatneſs, ſhall be interwoven in the diſcourſes of the Militia of theſe two famous Nations.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>SInce we have found out but little of the true Militia of other Ancient Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, let us take a ſurvey of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Art of War, which hath been in many ages, and ſtill is ſo much ſpoken of. And herein we muſt borrow all our help from <hi>Aelian,</hi> who, you will find, hath given it us very ſparingly. For though we have the works of <hi>Homer,</hi> and that he is accounted the firſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Author, who wrote any thing of formed Battels; yet we are not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect much light from ſo blind a Lanthorn. <hi>Polybius,</hi> though a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and a Captain, contributes nothing to our aſſiſtance, but what we are glad to glean from the ſcattered drops of his Pen. The reſt of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Tacticks nam'd<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Grecian</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticks loſt.</note> by <hi>Aelian</hi> in his Treatiſe, are loſt, except ſome pieces of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> tranſlated into <hi>Latine</hi> ſeventy years ago by <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> which Sir <hi>Thomas Kellie</hi> thought were likewiſe periſh'd. But truly we need not much regret that loſs, if that<note place="margin">And no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> which <hi>Aelian</hi> (who perus'd them all) tells us, be true, that they wrote not, as if they intended to inſtruct thoſe who were ignorant and deſirous to learn; but as to thoſe who were already Proficients, who underſtood the words and terms of Art, and who knew the practice of the <hi>Grecian</hi> War, as well as the Authors themſelves.</p>
                  <p>All Armies and Forces were rais'd by a Levy called ordinarily in ancient times, and ſtill very properly, an Election. And truly, I am ſorry I ſhould ſo<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aelians</hi> omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> ſoon have occaſion to expoſtulate with <hi>Aelian,</hi> who hath forgot to tell us that, of which he ſhould have given us a particular information, and in the firſt place too; that is, how the levies of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Souldiers, either of Horſe or Foot, were made, at what age they were enroll'd in the Militia, and how long they were obliged to ſerve. Of theſe particulars I ſhall tell my Reader, that <hi>Lipſius</hi> out of <hi>Demoſthemes,</hi> ſaith, that none were elected till they were eighteen years old (this was a year later than the <hi>Romans</hi> choſe theirs) and that they were bound to ſerve till the five and fortieth year of their age. But <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> did indeed elect and enrol their Souldiers<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Grecian</hi> levy.</note> when they were eighteen years old, but made them only do Military duties within their own territories (which was, upon the matter, to train them) till they were twenty. After that, they were bound to ſerve in foreign expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons till they were forty, and then they were diſmiſs'd. I think it ſtrange, they would diſmiſs men in the very ſtrength of their age; I ſhould rather think, they then only left it to the Souldiers choice, to ſerve longer or not, as they pleas'd, but did not by any publick act or ordinance diſable or incapacitate them to ſerve longer in the War. I find alſo in Authors, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> had an eſpecial care (as all Nations ſhould) to chuſe perſons, who as members apt for ſeveral functions, were fit to compoſe the great Body of their <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx:</hi> For many can ſerve on Foot, who would make but bad Horſe-men; and many are able enough to carry a piece of light Armour, and Offenſive Weapons, who cannot bear the burthen of Head-piece, Corſlet, Greeves, Taſlets, and Targets. And this is ſhortly all I can ſay of the <hi>Grecians</hi> Election of their Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>The Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> compos'd their Armies of Horſe-men, Foot-men, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, and Elephants. Of the two laſt I have ſpoken. We are now to ſee how the other two were armed.</p>
                  <p>The Foot-men were divided into thoſe who carried heavy Arms, and thoſe who were light arm'd; and ſo were the Horſe; and both the heavy arm'd Foot and Horſe were called <hi>Cataphracti,</hi> and the light arm'd Foot had the denomination of <hi>Velites.</hi> The heavy arm'd Foot had for the Defenſive, a<note place="margin">Defenſive Arms for the heavy armed Foot.</note> Head-piece, a Corſlet, Greeves, and a Target; this laſt was round and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the middle, more than two Foot and a half in diameter; this the Souldier carried on his Back all the time of his march; but when he was to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97406:15"/> ſight, by a wry of his Body he made it fall on his left ſhoulder, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Pike with his left foot formoſt, his whole Body, till below the knee, was covered with his Target: All theſe Arms were of Braſs, and ſo were their Boots, which defended their Legs; for <hi>Homer</hi> tells us often of his <hi>bene ocreati Archivi.</hi> I cannot tell whether both their Legs were Booted, it may be only the left, becauſe moſt ſubject to danger. Inſtead of Braſs Targets, the Great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> gave Silver ones to thoſe <hi>Veteran Phalangites,</hi> who had helped him well to obtain ſo many glorious Victories; and thoſe who carried them were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Argyraſpides,</hi> or Silver Shields. Every man who carried a Shield had ſome Device on it, according to his own fancy; and I have read that one cauſed to be painted on his Shield a Fly, of as little a proportion as a living Fly is, and ſo ſcarce diſtinguiſhable on ſo great a Shield, for which his fellows and companions mock'd him, and ſaid, He had done ſo, that his Device not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcernable, he might not be purſued by an Enemy: but he anſwer'd, That his intention was to advance ſo near an Enemy, that any of them might ſee and perceive it was the picture of a Fly. The Offenſive Weapon for the<note place="margin">Offenſive.</note> heavy arm'd Foot, was a ſtrong Pike, ordinarily eighteen foot long, but the <hi>Macedonian</hi> was of one and twenty, and was called <hi>Sariſſa;</hi> theſe three foot of greater length gave a great advantage to thoſe who carried them, for aſſuredly, the longer the Pike is, it is the better, ſo it be manageable, as ſhall be ſaid hereafter: and therefore a Pike of four and twenty foot long, would have had the advantage of that of one and twenty. A good ſhearing Sword was alſo a Weapon for the <hi>Cataphracts,</hi> both Foot and Horſe, though <hi>Aelian,</hi> in all the accounts he gives us of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Armies or Arms, ſpeaks<note place="margin">Omiſſion of <hi>Aelian.</hi>
                     </note> not one word of a Sword. Perhaps he thought we were obliged to conceive, that all Souldiers were <hi>Sword-men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grecian Velites,</hi> or light arm'd Foot, for moſt part had no Defenſive<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Velites</hi> how armed.</note> Arms. Their Offenſive Weapons were Swords, Javelins, Darts, Arrows, and Stones, which they threw, both out of their Hands, and out of Slings: Some of them had alſo a ſhort Spear; and for Defence, a little Target, which the <hi>Macedonians</hi> called <hi>Pelta:</hi> But thoſe who carried them needed not make a third ſpecies of the Infantry, as <hi>Aelian</hi> ſeems to inſinuate; theſe <hi>Peltati</hi> being nothing but light armed Foot; for the beſt arm'd of them, were<note place="margin">Peltati.</note> not ſo well arm'd Defenſively, as the worſt arm'd of the <hi>Roman Velites;</hi> who notwithſtanding were but reckon'd among the light arm'd Infantry. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I wonder, why any of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> at leaſt of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> ſhould have wanted theſe <hi>Pelt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> or little Targets, with which they ought like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to have had Head-pieces or Morrions, as moſt of the <hi>Roman Velites</hi> had.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grecian</hi> Cavalry was likewiſe divided into two ſorts; the heavy arm'd, and light arm'd. The heavy arm'd were called <hi>Cataphracti,</hi> a word which both the <hi>Romans,</hi> and all other Nations, have borrowed from the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and though it be common to both Horſe and Foot, yet they have appropriated it only to the heavy arm'd Horſe-men. And here my Reader may obſerve, that theſe words <hi>Cataphracts, Gens d'Arms,</hi> Men of Arms, heavy arm'd Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Cuiraſſiers, ſignifie all one thing. The <hi>Grecian Cataphracts</hi> for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cataphracti</hi> how armed.</note> had Head-pieces, Backs and Breaſts, Greeves, Taſlets, and Boots of Iron or Braſs; and if I underſtand right, Targets; Their Horſes were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe arm'd. If theſe Riders ſo armed, were mounted on ſtrong and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Horſes, aſſuredly they were able, either to give or receive a very forcible and ſtrong charge and impreſſion. But being ſo heavy, were neither able to purſue an Enemy far, or run very ſpeedily from him. In this place <hi>Aelian</hi> is much to blame (as in many other places) and is here inexcuſable, for not<note place="margin">

The light armed Horſe-men were of two kinds,<note place="margin">Light Horſe how armed.</note>

The ſecond kind of light armed Horſe-men <hi>Aelian</hi> calls <hi>Ferentarii,</hi> other Authors call them <hi>Acrobaliſts,</hi> and theſe were ſub-divided into two ſorts; ſome uſed Darts, and were called <hi>Tarentines;</hi> and ſome had Bows and Arrows, and were called <hi>Scythae,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Scythians</hi> delighted much in the Bow.</p>

I think it ſtrange, that ſome attribute the invention of the moving or ambulatory Tower ſo much admired by Antiquity, to <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Son of <hi>Antigonus;</hi> for to me it is clear enough, that his Fathers Maſter the Great <hi>Alexander</hi> had one of them at the Siege of <hi>Gaza,</hi> which was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ineffectual by the deep Sand, through which it could not be brought ſo<note place="margin">The ambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Tower.</note> near the Walls, as was needful; for the Wheels, on which it was to move, ſunk down. Neither do I think that <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf was the inventor of it: Whether the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe, whoſe Belly was ſtuffed with armed men, might be ſuch a Machine as this, or whether it had only its exiſtency in the Poets brain, is no great matter. But becauſe the <hi>Romans</hi> uſed all theſe Warlike Engines at the expugnation and propugnation of Towns, I ſhall refer my Reader concerning them to the fourth Chapter of my Diſcourſes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, where I ſhall alſo ſhow him the ſubſtance of what <hi>Aeneas,</hi> an Ancient <hi>Grecian</hi> Tactick, ſaith on that ſubject. Here I ſhall only obſerve, that as the <hi>Grecians</hi> were very apt to uſurp to themſelves the invention of many Arts and Sciences, which they ſtole from others: So it will be found that many of theſe Machines were uſed in the World, before the <hi>Grecians</hi> were ſo much known, as afterwards they came to be. We read in the ſeventeenth Chapter of the ſecond Book of the <hi>Chronicles, That</hi> Ozias <hi>King of</hi> Judah, <hi>by the invention of skilful Maſters made and planted on the Towers and corners of the Walls of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>Engines which ſhot Arrows, Darts, and great Stones.</hi> And theſe were no other than thoſe Machines the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <hi>Catapults</hi> and <hi>Baliſts:</hi> And this was long before, the overthrows and defeats of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchs<note place="margin">Theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the <hi>Grecians.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Grecians</hi> were very exact in Training and drilling both their Horſe and Foot; and without queſtion, they taught their Souldiers very perfectly to handle and manage all the Arms they were appointed to carry, whether thoſe were Javelins, Darts, Stones, Slings, Swords, Pikes, Lances, Maces, or Bows and Arrows. And as careful they were to teach them thoſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Grecian</hi> words of Exerciſe</note> and evolutions, whereby their Bodies, whether ſmall or great, changed their preſent poſture into another, either by Facings, Doublings, Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marches, or Wheelings. And though the <hi>European</hi> Nations were forc'd to find out words of Command each in their own language, to teach the uſe and handling of the Piſtol, Carabine, Harquebuſs, Muſquet, or any other Fire-gun, in regard none of thoſe were known to any of the Autients; yet the handling of the Pike is the ſame in all its poſtures, that the <hi>Grecians</hi> had: And all our <hi>European</hi> words of Command for the motions and evolutions of Bodies, are borrowed from the <hi>Greek.</hi> By Example; That which they call'd<note place="margin">All one with ours.</note>

Yet here I ſhall take liberty to ſpeak a little of both their, and our Counter-marches, that hereafter I need not trouble either my ſelf or my Reader with that point of exerciſe, for which I have ſo ſmall an eſteem.</p>
                  <p>They called a Counter-march <hi>Evolutio per verſum,</hi> and they had three kinds of it, which are yet retained in our Modern Exerciſes; and theſe were the <hi>Macedonian,</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian,</hi> and the <hi>Perſian,</hi> which was alſo called the <hi>Choraean.</hi> The <hi>Macedonian</hi> is, when the Batallion is commanded to take up as much ground in the Van, as it poſſeſſed before, e're he who was Leader faced<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Macedonian</hi> Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march.</note> to the Rear. It is done thus: He who is in the Rear marcheth through or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Files to the Van, and then without an alt ſo many foot beyond the File-leader, as the Body at their due diſtance poſſeſſeth; all the reſt that were in the File before him, following him in order as they ſtood, till he making alt, they all take up their ſeveral diſtances behind him, till he who is File-leader turn himſelf about on that ſame ground he ſtood on, and then all turn likewiſe, ſo that all the File faceth to the Rear in that ſame order, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Counter-march it fac'd to the Van; by this means the Body loſeth ground in the Rear: and therefore our Modern Drillers, when they command the <hi>Macedonian</hi> counter-march, they ſay, By the Right or Left hand Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march, and loſe ground in the Rear, or gain ground in the Van, which is all one thing.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Laconian</hi> is, when the Batallion is commanded to take up as much ground in the Rear as it poſſeſs'd before, and is done thus. The File-leader<note place="margin">Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</note> turns juſt where he ſtands, and marcheth as many foot behind the Rear-man as the Body at its due diſtance ſhould poſſeſs, all who follow him turn not about, till their Leaders go by them, and ſo the Bringer up doth only turn himſelf without any further motion. The Modern word of Command for this is, Counter-march to the Right and Left hand, and gain ground in the Rear.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Perſian</hi> is, when the Batallion keeps the ſame ground it had, but with this difference, that the Leader ſtands where the Bringer up was, and the<note place="margin">Perſian.</note> Rear-man where the Leader ſtood. It is done thus: The Leader advanceth three ſteps, and then turns and marcheth to the Rear, and all who follow him turn not, till they come to that place to which he advanced, and then they face about, and take up the ſame ground they formerly poſſeſt. The word of Command for this is, Counter-march to the Right or Left hand and keep your ground. It is alſo called the <hi>Chor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> Father of the Great <hi>Alexander,</hi> put down the firſt of theſe Counter-marches, which was his own Countrey one, and with good reaſon; for it hath a ſhow of flying, at leaſt of retiring, being a Body of ſixteen deep (as the <hi>Macedonian Phalanx</hi> was) by that Counter-march loſt in the Rear (where the Enemy is ſuppos'd to be) one hundred and twelve foot of ground, one foot being allowed for every Rank to ſtand on, and ſix<note place="margin">All three of ſmall uſe.</note> foot of diſtance between the Ranks, at leaſt it loſeth one hundred and ſix foot. And truly, I think the hazard were ſmall, if all the three ſeveral Counter-marches were for ever baniſh'd out of all Armies, except thoſe of our Enemies. It is true, I never ſaw any of them uſed in ſight of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; for if they be practis'd then, I am confident, confuſion would follow them, which is but too ready to appear in any Army, though never ſo well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, when it is unexpectedly attack'd by an Enemy in the Rear.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Grecians</hi> had been acquainted with our great Guns, nay, even with our Muskets, which kill at a greater diſtance by far, than Darts or Arrows, and againſt which their Defenſive Arms would not have been proof; they would have found that an Enemy a good way from their Rear would have render'd their beſt Counter-marches both unfeaſible and dangerous. All the good, I ſuppoſe, that is intended by a Counter-march, is to place the very ſame men and Ranks with their faces to the Rear in that very ſame order they were, with their faces to the Front. And truly, if Captains be careful to place their beſt men in the Front, their next beſt in the Rear, and make middle men of the third, and rank every man according to his worth and dignity, as they ſhould do, (but too many of them are negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in this) it will be needleſs to hazard a Counter-march, but with much eaſe, and with one word of Command, (and that is, By the Right or Left hand about) an Enemy may be fac'd in the Rear, without danger of any confuſion or diſorder.</p>
                  <p>I have ſeen ſome very punctual Officers and Drill-maſters, who have taken much pains to teach new beginners all theſe three ſorts of Counter-marches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have made them practiſe their leſſons very exactly; yet for all that, I could never in my own Judgement, have a better opinion of Counter-marches, than, they ſay, ſome Phyſicians have of Cucumbers, which they firſt order to be well corrected and prepar'd with Vinegar, Oyl, Pepper, and I know not what elſe, and then adviſe, to throw them out of doors, or over the Windows.</p>
                  <p>In exerciſing Bodies, the firſt care is to make Ranks and Files keep that diſtance, that is allowed by the Prince or General who commands the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, for he may do in that according to his pleaſure. The <hi>Grecian</hi> Foot had a three-fold diſtance, the firſt was of ſix foot, and this <hi>Aelian</hi> will have to be in exerciſings and marches between File and File, as well as Rank and Rank; but aſſuredly there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was not ſo good reaſon for the one as there was for the other, in regard all the heavy arm'd Foot cartying long Pikes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſix foot in their march between Rank and Rank for the conveniency of their Pikes; but there was no need of ſo much between File and File, as<note place="margin">Diſtances of the Foot.</note> any man at firſt view, may eaſily comprehend. The ſecond diſtance was of three foot between Rank and Rank, as alſo between File and File, and this was when they were drawn up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſtood in Battel with their Pikes order'd; and their poſture at this diſtance was called <hi>Denſatio.</hi> The third was of one foot and a half between both Files and Ranks, and that was, when they were either to give or receive a charge, and it was call'd <hi>Conſtipati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The <hi>Grecian</hi> Horſe were marſhall'd in ſeveral figures, and of their diſtance I can ſay nothing, nor doth <hi>Aelian</hi> help me in it at all. Of theſe ſeveral figures of Horſe Troops, I ſhall ſpeak in the next Chapter but one.

                     <hi>Decurio.</hi> Obſerve here by the way, that <hi>Decurio</hi> is not always he who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ten men, as many of my profeſſion fanſie. The File had likewiſe its Tergiductor, who was our Bringer up: But in <hi>Aelians</hi> account this Rear-man
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97406:17"/> had no command, but was ſubject to the Middle-man, who under the Leader commanded the laſt half of the File. There were beſides in every File, as <hi>Aelian</hi> ſaith, four Enomotarchs, each whereof, ſaith he, had the command<note place="margin">A File.</note> of three men. But here aſſuredly our Author miſtakes himſelf, for four men, and each of them the command of three, make compleatly ſixteen, and ſo both File-leader and Middle-man were excluded. But certainly the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curia</hi> or Leader had the three men next him immediately under his command, and the fifth man was an Enomotarch, who had three under him, then the <hi>Dimarite</hi> or Middle-man, (who commanded the laſt half of the File) had the inſpection of the three men immediately following; and laſtly, the fifth man from the <hi>Dimarite,</hi> and thirteenth from the <hi>Decurio,</hi> had the three laſt men of the File recommended to his care. By this means, there are but four petty Commanders in every File, whereas <hi>Aelian</hi> unadviſedly and unatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively made fix. <hi>Lochos</hi> with the <hi>Grecians</hi> was our File, two of theſe made a Dilochy, which conſiſted of thirty two men; its Commander was called <hi>Dilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chita;</hi> We have no Officer to repreſent him but a Lance Speſate. Two Dilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies<note place="margin">Ennumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Bodies of the Foot.</note> or four Files made a Tetrarchy, whoſe number was ſixty four; its Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer was a Tetrarch, whom a Caporal in a Company of two hundred or three hundred men may reſemble. Two Tetrarchies made a Taxiarchy, its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander was called <hi>Taxiarcha,</hi> which <hi>Aelian</hi>'s Tranſlator renders <hi>Centurio;</hi> His command was of eight Files, which made one hundred twenty eight men. And here, I pray you obſerve, that <hi>Centurio</hi> was not always ſtrictly taken for a Captain of one hundred. And we ſhall find hereafter in the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia, his ordinary command was of ſixty, ſometimes but of thirty, as it is here of one hundred twenty eight. A Sergeant in an old <hi>French</hi> or <hi>German</hi> Company repreſents this <hi>Grecian</hi> Taxiarch. Two Taxiarchies, which were ſixteen Files, made a Syntagmatarchy of two hundred fifty ſix men; its Commander <hi>Syntagmatarcha</hi> was our private Captain. This Company was a ſquare of men, ſixteen in Rank and ſixteen in File, and whatever way you turn'd it, ſtill ſixteen. And if with <hi>Aelian,</hi> you allow ſix foot of diſtance between Files as well as Ranks, it will be a Body equilateral, and a ſquare of ground, as well as a ſquare of men. But of theſe manner of Battels I ſhall ſpeak particularly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>Two Syntagmatarchies compos'd a Pentecoſiarchy conſiſting of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twelve men; its Commander was called <hi>Pentecoſiarcha,</hi> or, in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Tribunus minor,</hi> we call him our Lieutenant Colonel. Two Pentecoſiarchies made a Chiliarchy of one thouſand twenty four men, its Commander was <hi>Chiliarcha,</hi> or <hi>Tribunus major<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> to whom anſwers directly our Modern Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of one thouſand men. Of two Chiliarchies was made up a Myriarchy<note place="margin">Compar'd with our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Bodies.</note> of two thouſand forty eight, its Commander was <hi>Myriarcha.</hi> About eighty years ago no Colonel in <hi>Germany</hi> had ſo few in his Regiment, but now we ſhall ſay that he was as our Brigadeer; Two Myriarchies made a Phalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy or ſimple Phalange, conſiſting of four thouſand ninety ſix men; its Commander was called <hi>Phalangiarcha,</hi> in <hi>Latine, Praeter;</hi> for whom ſuppoſe a modern Major General. Two Phalangarchies made a Diphalangarchy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of eight thouſand one hundred ninety two men; its Commander was called a <hi>Diphalangiarcha,</hi> for whom we have none but a Lieutenant General. Two of theſe made a Phalange, over which commanded the General of the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. By this account we find in every Phalange two Diphalangarchies, four Phalangarchies, eight Myriarchies, ſixteen Chiliarchies, two and thirty Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecofiarchies, ſixty four Syntagmatarchies: in all one thouſand twenty four Files, which conſiſted of ſixteen thouſand three hundred eighty four men, at ſixteen in every File.</p>
                  <p>Here you are to obſerve, that every Syntagmatarchy or private Company, conſiſting of two hundred fifty ſix men, had beſide the Captain and others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken of, five other Officers, whom <hi>Aelian</hi> calls ſupernumerary or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. Theſe were the Enſign-bearer (for every Company or Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagmatarchy had a Colours) a Servant or Aſſiſter, or if you pleaſe, you may call him an Adjutant, who carried the Captains Orders: The third was a<note place="margin">Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerary Officers.</note> 
                     <hi>Praeco,</hi> or a Cryer, who proclaim'd the Captains directions, even in the time of Battel. Men of ſtrong voices were choſen for that office. The <hi>Romans</hi> uſed them, as it appears by <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s cauſing them to be counterfeited when
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97406:18"/> he ſtorm'd and enter'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp at <hi>Capua.</hi> They are out of faſhion now, the loud noiſe of Gun-powder having render'd them uſeleſs. The fourth was a Trumpeter, whoſe office is known. And the laſt was a <hi>Tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dux</hi> or Lieutenant, whoſe office was to ſtay conſtantly in the Rear. Theſe five were ſuperordinary; the reſt were <hi>Ordinarii,</hi> and this word the Church hath borrowed from the Militia (and reaſon for it, ſince on earth ſhe is a Militant Body) in giving the name of Ordinaries to her reverend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</p>
                  <p>But in this place <hi>Aelian</hi> is obſcure, for I know not how he diſpoſeth of the Serjeant, or of the Captain of the Company, nor how he diſpoſeth of the Tribunes leſſer or greater, Lieutenant Colonels and Colonels, Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Major Generals, where he appoints them to march, or where to ſtand or officiate in time of action; or whether he reckons them in the number of the Phalange, which conſiſted of ſixteen thouſand three hundred<note place="margin">A Queſtion not anſwer'd.</note> eighty four men, or not. His Decurions, Dimarites, Enomotarchs, Dilochites, and Tetrarchs, are all of them, no doubt, of that number; neither can I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them any other place to march or fight in, but Rank and File, for they were no other but File-leaders, Middle-men, Lance-ſpeſats, and Caporals, all of whom carry Arms. But that all who commanded above them were in Rank and File, is a thing I cannot fanſie. And if the Captain was conſtantly in the Van or Front of his Company, why was the Lieutenant, whoſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was conſtantly in the Rear of it, call'd a ſuperordinary Officer, more than the Captain? And being all theſe five were conſtantly Officers in the Syntagmatarchy or Company, why ſhould they not be call'd ordinary Officers as well as the Taxiarch or Serjeant, or as the Syntagmatarch or Captain?</p>
                  <p>The light armed <hi>Grecian</hi> Foot, according to <hi>Aelian,</hi> were half the number of the heavy armed, and by this account they were eight thouſand one hundred ninety two. This he ſpeaks of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Foot, for the other <hi>Grecian</hi> Phalanges were not ſo ſtrong. Theſe light armed Foot were drawn<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Grecian</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</note> up, ſaith <hi>Aelian,</hi> eight deep. By this account they took up as much ground in Longitude, Rank, or Front, as the heavy armed Phalange did, and but half as much in File or depth.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VI. Aelian's</hi> marſhalling the <hi>Grecian</hi> Infantry examined.</head>
                  <p>TO hazard all at one caſt hath ever been thought a piece of madneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in very deſperate caſes, for in them neceſſity hath no Law. It is upon that ground that Leaders of Armies appoint Reſerves, ſome one, ſome two, to ſuſtain and ſecond the firſt Batallions, in caſe they be worſted. But this great Body or Phalange of <hi>Aelian</hi> admitted of no reſerve at all, and therefore the men that compos'd it, had need to have fought well; becauſe firſt, there were none to ſecond them, and next their heavy Armour render'd them uncapable to fly either faſt or far.</p>
                  <p>That the Phalange might have had Reſerves, is unqueſtionable, if thoſe who compos'd it, had not made it ſo deep, as ſixteen. But we ſhall the better know,<note place="margin">Sixteen deep examin'd.</note> whether it might not conveniently have been of a leſs altitude, when we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Reaſons that are given for ſo great a depth. For take it along with you, the more a Batallion is extended in length or Front, the more hands are brought to fight, and the leſs it is ſubject to be out-wing'd or ſurrounded; and therefore the deepneſs of this Phalange brings both thoſe inconveniencies with it. Let us now hear the advantages it hath.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Aelian</hi> ſaith, if it be needful that the Files be doubled, the Phalange may be made two and thirty deep; and if the Ranks muſt be doubled, then
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97406:18"/> the Files are made eight deep. I wonder to hear ſuch language from ſo<note place="margin" type="runSum">Firſt reaſon for 16 deep.</note> great a Maſter; for all this may be done in any Body of men of what depth ſoever, provided it be not of an odd number. If <hi>Aelian</hi> had made his Phalange but twelve deep, might he not, when he pleas'd, by doubling the Files, have made it twenty four deep, and by doubling the Ranks, have made it but ſix deep, and by the bargain he had made the Front of his Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lange a fourth part longer, that where at ſix foot diſtance between Files it took up in longitude but ſix thouſand one hundred forty four foot, it would have taken up eight thouſand one hundred ninety foot? But the myſtery of the matter (if I underſtand <hi>Aelian</hi> right) is ſhortly this, Such an altitude or deepneſs of the File is moſt exact, whereby the Commander in chief may with few words bring his whole numbers by equal proportions to one man: As ſixteen to eight, eight to four, four to two, and two to one. But this you cannot do with twelve; for twelve divided makes two ſixes, ſix divided makes two threes; three men you cannot divide, unleſs you cut one man in two pieces. Now by ſixteen deep, you may bring your whole Batallion of ſixteen thouſand three hundred eighty four men into one File, or into one Rank, and here, I ſuppoſe, lyes the knack of the buſineſs. Theſe ſixteen thouſand three hundred eighty four men, at ſixteen in File, make one thouſand twenty four Files, which you can bring to one File, thus: Command your half Ranks to double their Files, and then you have but five hundred and twelve Files; the ſame word of Command being obeyed, you have but two hundred fifty ſix; give it once more, you have but one hundred twenty eight; let it be done over again, you ſhall ſee but ſixty four Files; continue the ſame word of Command, your Files come to thirty two, next to ſixteen, after that to eight, from that to four, then to two, and laſtly to one. And ſo you have your whole Phalange in one File. If you will have your Phalange all in one Rank, command the Middle-men or half Files to double their Ranks, and then ſixteen become eight; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ſame thing, they ſhall be but four, then two, and laſtly one. But is it not very ſtrange, that <hi>Aelian</hi> would not know, that all this might have<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> been done with a Body of men four deep, or eight deep, which laſt many of the <hi>Grecians</hi> did not exceed: And certainly, till we hear ſome more ſolid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than this aiery one, eight deep is for many conſiderations to be preferr'd to ſixteen. Nor ſhould this pretended reaſon hinder either Prince or State to appoint the depth of their Batallions to be twelve, ten, eight, or ſix deep, as they think fit, though by ſome of them, the Bodies cannot be ſubdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded till they come to one File, or one Rank; for it was never ſeen, nor do I fanſie it can be imagin'd, that ever ſuch an emergency of War will fall out, that can move a General, (unleſs he be to File his Army along a very narrow Bridge, or a very narrow way) to marſhal all his Foot either in one Rank, or one File. So I conceive the firſt reaſon is no reaſon at all.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Reaſon is, In time of Action an Enemy may charge the<note place="margin" type="runSum">Second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for 16 deep.</note> Rear, to rencounter whom, the <hi>Dimarit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> or Middle-men are commanded with the Half-Files that follow them, to face about (but without counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march) and ſuſtain the charge. By the way obſerve, that in ſuch an occaſion the Bringer up or Rear-man hath the command of the Half-File, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the Dimarite or Middle-man himſelf, to whom <hi>Aelian</hi> gave it before. But to the reaſon it ſelf I give two anſwers. Firſt, a Reſerve, which <hi>Aelians</hi> Phalange admits not, would prevent that danger. Secondly, I ſay; if they were but twelve in File, nay, but ten in File, they might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> the charge of an Enemy in both Van and Rear, as well as being ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen deep, which I make appear out of <hi>Aelian</hi> himſelf, thus: The <hi>Grecian</hi> Pikes were all eighteen Foot long, except the <hi>Macedonians</hi> which were twenty one. We ſhall ſpeak of the longeſt. Next, <hi>Aelian</hi> allows one foot and a half of diſtance between Ranks, when they fought, which diſtance he or his Interpreter calls <hi>Conſtipatio.</hi> Thirdly, the ſame Author allows three foot of the Pikes length for his hands who preſents it. Theſe grounds being laid, which are the Authors own, I ſay, that only four Ranks of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Pikes, and five of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> could do an Enemy any hurt; and but hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo either, becauſe between five Ranks, there are four diſtances, and for thoſe you are to allow ſix foot, at <hi>Aelians</hi> account, of cloſeſt diſtance; next, you are by his rule likewiſe to allow fifteen foot of the Pikes of the fifth Rank
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97406:19"/> to be abated from their length, which fifteen being added to ſix, make one and twenty; for three foot of the Pikes length of the firſt Rank being allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their hands who hold them, you muſt of neceſſity grant the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion for the reſt. And ſo the <hi>Macedonian Sariſſa</hi> did not much advance its point from the fifth Rank beyond the firſt Rank, and therefore the reſt behind theſe five Ranks ſeem uſeleſs. But an Enemy attacks the Rear, to oppoſe whom, let five Ranks face about, and preſent; for if five be ſufficient to reſiſt the ſhock in the Van, certainly five may do the ſame in the Rear. And if you will conſider it well, you will think the points of the Pikes of five Ranks ſufficient to give or receive a charge, if all the Files be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>err'd together as the <hi>Grecians</hi> were, and as all ſhould be, that no interval be given an Enemy to enter between them. If then ten Ranks were enough to reſiſt an Enemy in Front and Rear, I preſume, the other ſix might have been diſpos'd of two ways; firſt, they might have been beſtow'd on the Front, and ſo have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it to a far greater length, which would have brought more hands to fight, and not only ſav'd the Phalange from being out-wing'd, but have put it in a capacity to out-wing the Enemy: Secondly, theſe ſix Ranks might very advantagiouſly have compos'd a Body apart in the Rear, and that ſhould have been a Reſerve, and then no danger of an Enemy to have troubled the Battel behind.</p>
                  <p>But I am afraid you may think I am making up a <hi>Grecian</hi> Militia of my own, unknown to the famous Warriours of that renowned Nation. I ſhall tell you truly and ingenuouſly, my quarrel is only with <hi>Aelian,</hi> becauſe he hath not told us ſo much as he knew, and ſo much as he was oblig'd to tell us, which in this particular is that I am now to tell you, and it conſiſts in two things, one that Phalanges were not always ſixteen deep, and ſecondly, that they wanted not always Reſerves: To prove both, be pleaſed to take the following Inſtances. At <hi>De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s,</hi> when the <hi>Athenians</hi> fought with the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> and other <hi>Boeotians,</hi> the Phalanges were all of them eight d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>p, and all<note place="margin">Phalanges eight deep.</note> of them had Reſerves. At <hi>Leuctra, Epaminondas</hi> his Foot Batallions were all marſhall'd in eight Ranks. At <hi>Siracuſa,</hi> when the <hi>Athenian</hi> General <hi>Nicia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> was to fight, he plac'd his Auxiliaries in the two Wings, his <hi>Athenians</hi> he divided into two great Bodies; the half whereof he marſhall'd in the Battel between the two Wings, the other half he plac'd behind at a diſtance, with<note place="margin">And had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.</note> command, to ſuccour either the Wings or the Battel, as they ſaw them, or any of them ſtand in need of their help, and this was a perfect Reſerve: And obſerve, that his Wings, Battel and Reſerve, were all marſhall'd eight deep. Take <hi>Thucydides,</hi> a noble Hiſtorian, and a good Captain for my Author.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, theſe were not <hi>Macedonian</hi> Phalanges, true; but they were <hi>Grecian</hi> ones though, and the Commanders of them without all perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, did well enough foreſee, in what danger their Phalanges of eight deep might be by a ſudden charge of an Enemy in the Rear, which, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, they would have oppos'd, by making the laſt four Ranks face about, if their Reſerves ſerv'd not their turn, neither could the fourth Rank extend its Pikes (being three foot ſhorter than the <hi>Macedonian</hi> ones) much beyond the firſt Rank. But to take the Objection more fully, let us come nearer, and view the Great <hi>Alexanders</hi> Army at <hi>Arbela,</hi> and we ſhall ſee, he was not at all limited by <hi>Aelians</hi> rules of a <hi>Macedonian</hi> Phalange, though by it, they ſay, he conquer'd the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy. Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> ſaith right, that in this place <hi>Alexander</hi> drew up his Forces, ſo that they fac'd to Van, Rear, and both Flanks; but this is not to be underſtood ſo, that he made his heavy armed Phalange front four ſeveral ways: for then it ſhould have been immovable, and only apt to reſiſt, but not to advance, which had been both againſt the intentions of that brave Prince, and his actions of that day; for he charg'd the <hi>Perſian</hi> Batallions both with his Horſe and Foot. But the meaning muſt be, that he order'd ſome Horſe and Foot at a diſtance from his main Battel to face to the Rear, for preventing any misfortune there, and the like he did on both his Flanks; but all theſe, when his main Battel mov'd, fac'd to the Van, and advanced with it, and when it ſtood, they took up their former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and fac'd as they were appointed: And all this was done, leſt his Army (ſmall in compariſon of that with <hi>Darius</hi>) ſhould be ſurrounded. If the Army
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97406:19"/> he was afraid to be out-wing'd, as aſſuredly he was, it will eaſily be granted<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Alexander</hi> at <hi>Arbela</hi> but eight deep;</note> that the more ground he took up in Front, the leſs ſubject he was to that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And this <hi>Curtius</hi> confirms, when he tells us, that the Commanders of the ſeveral Bodies had orders given them, to extend their Batallions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as far in length, as without eminent danger they might, leſt, ſaith the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, they ſhould be environ'd. I conceive then, it cannot be doubted, but <hi>Alexander</hi> ſtudying how to make as large a Front as feaſibly he might, againſt ſo numerous an Enemy, he made his heavy arm'd Foot Phalange but eight deep, as that which ſuited beſt with his preſent affairs, and as he had ſeen other <hi>Grecian</hi> Captains do before him, for by that means he made himſelf maſter of twice as much ground, as he had when it was marſhall'd ſixteen in File. That he had Reſerves, is moſt clear both from <hi>Curtius</hi> and others, for <hi>Nicanor</hi> follow'd the Phalange with the <hi>Argyraſpides,</hi> or Silver Shields, and theſe were heavy armed, (obſerve it) and <hi>Cenos</hi> with a Band of men, which,<note place="margin">And had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves.</note> ſaith <hi>Curtius,</hi> was appointed (note this) to be a Relief. Then <hi>Horeſtes, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certa, Polycarpon,</hi> and <hi>Philagus,</hi> all with ſeveral Bodies follow'd the Phalanx. And that all theſe were Reſerves, <hi>Aelian</hi> himſelf, nor any for him, will not be ſo impudent as to deny. But I ſhall ſpeak more of the marſhalling this Army in the Chapter following the next.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the third Reaſon, which is pretended for ſixteen deep of<note place="margin" type="runSum">Third reaſon for 16 deep.</note> the heavy armed Phalange. And it is this. Though the Pikes of all thoſe Ranks, that ſtand behind the fifth, or if you will, the ſixth, be uſeleſs; in regard they can reach but little or nothing beyond the File leader (and you will remember theſe Ranks are not fewer than ten, if not eleven) yet being at cloſe order, with their Pikes advanc'd, they bear forward with the weight and force of their Bodies thoſe five or ſix Ranks that are before them, and ſo make the Impreſſion the greater and ſtronger, they take all occaſion of flight from them, and impoſe a neceſſity on them to overcome or dye. I anſwer firſt, that this pretended advantage, if it was any at all, was very oft dear<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> bought. Secondly, I ſay, five Ranks having their Pikes preſented to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, three Ranks behind them might have ſerv'd ſufficiently to bear forward the five before them; or if <hi>Aelian</hi> thought ſix Ranks might preſent all their Pikes with advantage, then let four Ranks be allowed behind them to bear them forward to the charge and hinder them to fly, and this will make in all but ten Ranks, and ſo ſtill ſix Ranks might have been diſpoſed of either to enlarge the Front, or make a Body in the Rear for a Reſerve. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſay, when <hi>Aelian</hi>'s ſix formoſt Ranks were buſie in fight, the ten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, who were to bear thoſe ſix forward, were at their cloſeſt diſtance (which he calls conſtipation) and ſo not able to open very ſuddenly, and face about in ſo good order, and ſo ſoon as was requiſite to receive, or beat back the charge of an unexpected Enemy: For certainly they muſt firſt have open'd backward, and then fac'd about; both which muſt have been done by the command of ſome of their Officers, probably the Lieutenant, and it is well enough known<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how confuſion and diſorder (which ſeldome fails to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſuch occaſions) ſtops the ears, and dulls the judgement of Souldiers, that they can neither hear nor underſtand the words of Command aright. I will fetch two inſtances from Hiſtory, and thoſe, I believe, will prove all I have ſaid, and clear this whole matter pretty well.</p>

                     </note> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> except one, againſt <hi>Titus Flaminius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul, the half of <hi>Philips</hi> heavy armed Phalange on the right hand, bore down all before it, and trod over the Legions, gaining ground ſo far, that the <hi>Macedonian</hi> thought the day his own. But <hi>Flaminius</hi> having obſerv'd that the left Wing of the Phalange could not draw up in any cloſe order, becauſe of the unevenneſs and knottineſs of the Mountain (whoſe little hillocks repreſented the heads of Dogs) ſent a Tribune with a Legion and ſome Elephants up the Hill, to charge that Left Wing, which he ſmartly doing, eaſily routed it, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fell on the Rear of the victorious Right wing, and without oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, cut it in pieces. Now, if the Left Wing of the Phalange, which had no convenient ground whereon to draw up, had plac'd it ſelf on the top of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97406:20"/> Hill at a diſtance behind the Right Wing, as a Reſerve, the <hi>Romans</hi> durſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have hazarded to have come between them; or if the laſt ten Ranks of the Right Wing who ſerv'd for nothing but to bear forward the other ſix Ranks, had fac'd about (according to <hi>Aelians</hi> rule) they could not ſo eaſily have been broken. But the cloſe poſture or conſtipation of theſe laſt ten Ranks to bear forward the formoſt ſix Ranks, made them uncapable to do that quickly, which the preſent neceſſity required, or elſe the ſudden charge of an unlook'd for Enemy did ſo appal them, that they knew not what they were doing, nor who commanded, or who obeyed, which, as I have ſaid, frequently falls out in ſuch caſes. So this Phalanx caſt in <hi>Aelian</hi>'s <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi> mould, coſt King <hi>Philip</hi> very dear, but another modell'd after the ſame faſhion, coſt his Son <hi>Perſeus</hi> much dearer.</p>

If but a third, nay, a fourth or fifth part of this Phalange had been ſtanding at a convenient diſtance in Reſerve, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to have charg'd the weary and diſorder'd Legions, will any man doubt, but that in all humane probability, <hi>Perſeus</hi> had been Maſter of the Field? But the want of that loſt him, in the twinkling of an eye, his Wife and Children, his Kingdom, his Riches (which he lov'd too well) his Honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at laſt his Life.</p>
                  <p>The Defect then of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Phalange, as <hi>Aelian</hi> deſcribes it, was<note place="margin">Defects of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lange.</note> two-fold; Firſt, by the exorbitant deepneſs of its File, it took not up ground enough in the Front, and next it admitted not of a Reſerve.

But I am of opinion, that <hi>Aelian</hi> in his days, never ſaw any thing (except in figures) ſo like the other <hi>Grecian</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langarchies, as we may ſee very frequently in our Modern Wars, for he wrote his Tacticks to the Emperour <hi>Adrian,</hi> who liv'd ſome Centuries after the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Phalange was forc'd to do homage to the <hi>Roman</hi> Legion.</p>
                  <p>Our Author tells us, that the <hi>Velites,</hi> or light armed foot were half the<note place="margin">Velites.</note> number of the heavy armed, but we ſhall ſee hereafter that this held but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. He will alſo have them to be eight deep, becauſe the heavy arm'd were ſixteen in File. By this rule, the other <hi>Grecians,</hi> who marſhall'd their heavy arm'd eight in File, ſhould have drawn up their Velites but four deep. <hi>Aelian</hi> doth alſo appoint them to be drawn up behind the Phalange, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he might make them ſtand, perhaps march, where he pleas'd; but the manner of their Fight being <hi>a la disbandad,</hi> we may believe, they kept but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good order in fighting with an Enemy, leſs in purſuing him, and leaſt of all in flying from him.</p>

                  <p>IT ſeems the <hi>Greeks</hi> did not tye themſelves to any preciſe or certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Horſe in their Armies, as <hi>Aelian</hi> hath tyed them to a determinate number of Foot, ſome of, them uſing more, ſome fewer, as they conceiv'd needful for managing the preſent War they had in hand, augmenting, and diminiſhing the numbers of their Horſe Troops, as alſo the number of the men of each Troop, as they found their occaſions required. <hi>Aelian</hi> tells us, that<note place="margin">Officers of a Horſe Troop.</note> every Troop of Horſe had a Captain, whoſe place was in the Van; a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, whoſe ſtation was in the Rear; and a Cornet, who, he ſaith, ſtood with his Standard in the ſecond Rank next him who was on the Right hand of the Troop. All theſe we have. He ſaith, it had likewiſe two Flank Commanders, who, if they rode in Rank, are repreſented by our Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. He tells us nothing of a Quarter-maſter; perhaps one of theſe Flank-Officers was he, or officiated for him. But that wherein he is very forgetful, is, that he makes no mention of a Trumpeter; but aſſuredly, ſince every Foot Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, called a Syntagmatarchy that had Colours, was allow'd a Trumpeter, every Troop of Horſe having a Standard had likewiſe one, if not more. Nor ſpeaks he of Horn-winders, though theſe were uſed by the <hi>Grecians,</hi> as other Authors tell us.

                  <p>I find the <hi>Grecians</hi> uſed three kinds of Battels of Horſe ordinarily, not to<note place="margin">Three for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> of Horſe Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions.</note> ſpeak of extravagant ones. Theſe were the Rhombus, the Wedge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Square. The <hi>Theſſulians,</hi> who were thought to be the firſt and perfecteſt Horſe-men in <hi>Europe,</hi> uſed the Rhombus: The invention of the Wedge is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> Father of <hi>Alexander;</hi> and the Square was uſed by them both, as alſo by all the other <hi>Grecians;</hi> who ſometimes made uſe likewiſe of the other two forms.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:97406:21"/>
                  <p>A Rhombus is a Geometrical Figure conſiſting of four acute Angles, and<note place="margin">The firſt is the Rhombus.</note> four ſides equilateral, or if you imagine two equilateral Triangles joyn'd back to back, and their Angles equidiſtant (for when two Triangles are joyn'd, both of them have but four corners) you conceive the figure of a Rhombus right enough. To explain the Rhombus Horſe Battel, let us imagine a Troop to conſiſt of ſixty four Riders, which number <hi>Aelian</hi> gives to a <hi>Macedonian</hi> Troop. Theſe ſixty four were thus marſhall'd. Next the Captain ſtood one Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,<note place="margin">Simple Rhombus.</note> behind him two, next them three, behind them four, then five, then ſix, then ſeven, then eight: That Rank of eight made two Angles, where the two Flank Commanders ſtood; for behind that Rank the number decreas'd, as thus: Behind the eight ſtood ſeven, then ſix, then five, then four, then three, then two, and laſtly one. Add all theſe together, you will find the aggregate to be ſixty four. Behind the laſt one, to my ſenſe, ſtood the Lieutenant, though <hi>Aelian</hi> in ſome of his Figures, ſeems to make the Captain and Lieutenant to be two of the number; and if the two Flank Commanders were ſo too, then the Troop conſiſted only of ſixty, beſides Officers, and not of ſixty four.</p>
                  <p>There is another kind of Rhombus, which in ſome ſenſe may be called a<note place="margin">The greater Rhombus.</note> double one, and it is marſhall'd by increaſing the number of every Rank after the firſt by two, till you come to the eighth Rank, and after that, your number is to decreaſe by two in every Rank till you come to one, and then your Rhombus ſhall conſiſt of one hundred and thirteen Riders, as thus: Firſt one, behind him three, behind them five, behind them ſeven, then nine, then eleven, then thirteen, and in the eighth Rank place fifteen; from that Rank your number decreaſeth, for next to fifteen you are to place thirteen, behind them eleven, then nine, then ſeven, then five, then three, and laſtly one. This is alſo a <hi>Theſſalian</hi> Rhombus of Horſe, a Figure whereof <hi>Aelian</hi> beſtows upon us. This Troop, I conceive, being at open order (for it was very requiſite it ſhould be ſo) could upon an occaſion front any way without wheeling, to the Right or Left hand, by a half turn of their Horſes, and to the Rear by two half turns, and immediately thereafter ſerr together, either to give or receive the charge. This Figure of the Rhombus is call'd by ſome the Diamond; but if ſo, the Diamond which it reſembles, muſt be a four-corner'd one. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve here, that <hi>Aelians</hi> number of Horſe repreſented in his Figure of the Simple Rhombus amounts but to forty nine; and this I attribute to his neglect, for he told us it ſhould conſiſt of ſixty four.</p>
                  <p>The Wedge Battel, which the <hi>Latines</hi> called <hi>Cuneus</hi> or <hi>Roſtrum,</hi> was a Body<note place="margin">The ſecond is the Wedge.</note> of men, either on Foot or Horſe-back, drawn up with a ſharp point, and encreaſing in its bigneſs, till it came to that greatneſs, which the maker of it deſign'd for it, and ſo repreſented a Wedge, from which it hath its deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; or it is like a Dagger, ſharp at the point, growing broader till it come to the haft. I told you, that <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> invented it, chooſing a Wedge to be the fitteſt pattern whereby to model his <hi>Macedonian</hi> Troops, by placing his choiceſt Men and Horſes, both for ſtrength of body and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of mind in the formoſt Ranks, the reſt behind them ſerving to bear them forcibly forward. Take the deſcription of it thus: Firſt one, then three, then five, then ſeven, then nine, then eleven, then thirteen, and laſtly fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen: Theſe added together make up <hi>Aelian</hi>'s <hi>Macedonian</hi> Troop of ſixty four Horſe-men. But in his deſcription of it he overſees himſelf twice; firſt, in<note place="margin">A twofold miſtake.</note> his words, for he ſaith the Wedge is juſt the half of the number of the great Rhombus, but that conſiſts, as I juſt now told you, of one hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, and the Wedge is of ſixty four, much more than the half of one hundred and thirteen. Next in his Figure, which preſents us only with thirty ſix Horſe-men, twenty eight fewer than King <hi>Philips</hi> Troop. But if you would take a Wedge out of the Rhombus, you may do it eaſily, by cauſing that Rank wherein are fifteen Horſe-men, with all the Ranks that are before it, to ſtand, and all that are behind it, to remove, and then you have a perfect <hi>Macedonian</hi> Wedge Troop, conſiſting of ſixty four Riders.</p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:97406:21"/>
                  <p>But the manner of embatteling in form of a Wedge was not appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated<note place="margin">Wedge Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels of Foot.</note> only to the Cavalry; The Infantry both of <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſeveral other Nations uſed it in many occaſions: <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> that famous <hi>Theban,</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Mantinea,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> ſtand ſtoutly to it, (after he had routed their Confederates the <hi>Athenians</hi>) choſe out a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of his gallanteſt Foot, caſt them in a Wedge, and broke ſo forcibly in upon their Batallion, that he pierc'd it, and after brave reſiſtance, forc'd them to quit the Field; but this prov'd his laſt action, for in it he receiv'd ſo many mortal wounds, that he dyed of them before the next day. I ſhall ſpeak more of this Wedge Battel in my diſcourſes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia. Neither it nor the Rhombus have been heard of in the World in many ages ſince thoſe antient times. It is probable, the Great <hi>Alexander</hi> permitted his <hi>Theſſalians</hi> to make uſe of the Rhombus at <hi>Arbela,</hi> becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt half of their Great Rhombus might face to the Rear, and ſo prevent ſurrounding by <hi>Darius</hi> his numerous forces. It is alſo like, that his <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi> Horſe might have kept the form of a Wedge both at <hi>Iſſus</hi> and <hi>Arbela.</hi> And I find, that his great Captains (who after his death ſhar'd his vaſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts among themſelves) uſed it frequently. But I believe likewiſe, that both he and they, and other <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Aſians</hi> too, made uſe of the Square Battel.</p>
                  <p>The Square form of embattelling was moſt commonly uſed by the <hi>Grecians</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The third is the Square.</note> in marſhalling their Infantry, and moſt of them us'd it in ordering their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry. I ſpeak not of an equilateral Square, but an oblong one, ſuch as we uſe in our modern Wars. Yet I do not deny, but the Antients ſeveral times uſed equilateral Square forms of their Batallions, as when they made their Ranks and Files conſiſt of equal numbers of men, and this we call a Battel Square of men, or ſometimes Square of ground, when the Front was of no greater extent of ground than the Flank, but of theſe I ſhall ſpeak hereafter, when I come to diſcourſe of the Square Root. Not only many of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> but the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Sicilians</hi> uſed the Square Horſe Battel, and many great<note place="margin">Preferr'd to the other two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> Captains preferr'd it to both the Rhombus and the Wedge; firſt, becauſe by it the Troops <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>could march with more celerity and convenience, and next, they could bring more hands to fight at one time. As for Example, in a Wedge Troop of ſixty four, the firſt Rank conſiſts but of one, the ſecond of three, the third of five, and the fourth of ſeven: In theſe four Ranks there are but ſixteen Riders. Oppoſe a Square Battell'd Troop of ſixty, and marſhal it in an oblong, fifteen in Rank and four in File, you may ſee that the ſixteen Riders in the four firſt Ranks of the Wedge muſt fight with all the ſixty of the Square Troop; this is a very great odds, and as much may be ſaid of the Rhombus. But <hi>Aelian</hi> doth not at all tell us, how deep the <hi>Grecian</hi> Square Battels of Horſe were.</p>
                  <p>This was a great neglect, for thereby we might have known how many of<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aelian</hi> ſpeak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> nothing of the deepneſs of Horſe Files.</note> the Ranks could have reach'd an Enemy with their Lances, and whether the reſt behind ſerv'd only to bear forward thoſe before, as the ten laſt Ranks of Pikes did to the ſix formoſt. Yet as far as I can conjecture by ſome of his Figures, he ſeems to inſinuate, that his Countrey-men order'd their Horſe to be half as many in File, as they were in Rank. His Figure of that Phalanx, which he calls <hi>Quadrata,</hi> of fifty Horſe, hath ten in Rank and five in File. This manner of Battel (whether it be of Horſe or Foot) is called by the Square Root men a Doubled Batallion, of the faſhion of which, and how it is done, I ſhall ſhew you in its proper place. But I dare not believe that all <hi>Grecian</hi> Troops were marſhall'd ſo, neither indeed doth <hi>Aelian</hi> aver it. I know not then, why I may not imagine a <hi>Grecian</hi> Troop of Horſe, conſiſting of ſixty four, to be marſhall'd three deep, as moſt of our Modern Troops now are, and ſo there ſhould have been in it twenty one Files, for 21 multiplied by three produceth ſixty three, and he who ſhall make the ſixty fourth, ſhall be the Trumpeter, with whom we could not meet before in <hi>Aelian</hi>'s enumeration of the Officers of a Troop.</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:97406:22"/>
                  <p>What diſtances were kept between Ranks or Files, between ſeveral Troops, or yet between greater Bodies of the Horſe, <hi>Aelian</hi> tells us not: Yet writing of the right ordering of Batallions, I think, he was obliged to ſpeak of Diſtances, for who can marſhal an Army, unleſs thoſe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended<note place="margin">Nor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</note> on? I conceive, that aſſuredly the Rhombus was oblig'd to keep a great Diſtance both between its Ranks and its Files, otherwiſe it could not turn to either Right or Left hand, or to the Rear, without Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and this, if I miſtake not, was one of the advantages the <hi>Theſſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> propoſed to themſelves, by that form of Horſe Battel. But when either it or the Wedge was to charge, they were oblig'd to ſerr together as cloſe as they could, otherwiſe they could not pierce ſo home, as was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by thoſe who caſt them in thoſe moulds. It is probable, that the Square Bodies of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Horſe were exercis'd, did march and fight at thoſe diſtances uſed now in our Modern Militia.</p>
                  <p>Our Author makes the number of the Cavalry in a <hi>Macedonian</hi> Army, to be half the number of their Velites, or light armed Foot. I told you, thoſe were eight thouſand one hundred ninety two, therefore the Horſe muſt be four thouſand ninety ſix.

                  <p>APhalanx ſignifieth a number of men, great or ſmall, Train'd and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed<note place="margin">The ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx.</note> in Military Duties, and order'd in Ranks and Files. By this Definition any Foot Company, or Horſe Troop is a Phalanx, as well as an Army; and a whole Army is a Phalanx, as well as a particular Company or Troop. It is true, in Authors, the word Phalanx is ordinarily taken for the great Body of ſixteen thouſand three hundred eighty four heavy armed Foot, which formerly I have out of <hi>Aelian</hi> deſcribed to you, of which I ſhall tell you thus much more, that he ſaith it had two Horns (for ſo the Tranſlator renders the word <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But indeed I wonder why <hi>Aelian</hi> divides the whole Phalange of Foot into two Horns, Right and Left; and why ſo many of our Commanders in the Modern Wars imitate him, in dividing a whole Body into the Right or Left Wing; never conſidering, that naturally and really there is a Body between two Wings: and the ſame error is committed, in dividing a whole Batallion of armed men into two Flanks, very ordinarily done by ſome Drill-maſters. And here, no doubt, <hi>Aelian</hi> forgot himſelf; for the Phalange of the heavy armed Foot was divided, as I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>old you before, into four leſſer Phalanges or Phalangarchies, two whereof made the two Wings, which he calls Horns; and the other two compos'd the Body. Theſe four Phalangarchies made three Intervals, how great we know not, out of<note place="margin">Phalangar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies.</note> which, before the fight, iſſued the light armed; and if they prevail'd, they purſued their Victory, being followed by the Phalange; but if they were beaten, as for moſt part they were, they retired to the Rear the ſame way they came, and then the four Phalangarchies cloſed together, to give or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the charge, according as they were ordered by their Superiours.</p>
                  <p>But now I am to ſpeak of the whole <hi>Macedonian</hi> Army, which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<note place="margin">The great <hi>Macedonian</hi> Phalanx of both Horſe and Foot.</note> the Great Phalanx, conſiſting of heavy and light armed Foot and Horſe, not reckoning their Chariots and Elephants. Their heavy armed Foot were ſixteen thouſand three hundred eighty four, the Velites were eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand one hundred ninety two, the Horſe four thouſand ninety ſix: Add all theſe together, you will find the <hi>Macedonian</hi> great Phalanx to conſiſt of twenty eight thouſand ſix hundred ſeventy two Combatants.</p>
                  <p>A Story goes, that either the Great <hi>Alexander,</hi> or <hi>Julius C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But I do not at all believe that either of them ſaid ſo, for true Hiſtories (if there be any truth in Hiſtories) aſſure us, that both of them had Armies which far exceeded that number.

At <hi>Iſſus</hi> he was ſtronger, and at <hi>Arbela</hi> he had forty thouſand Foot, and ſeven thouſand Horſe, all <hi>Grecians,</hi> beſides very many <hi>Aſians</hi> whom he had ſubdued. So we ſee that <hi>Aelians</hi> numbers of Horſe or Foot, did not hold even in the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Armies.</p>
                  <p>Much leſs will his rule hold in other <hi>Grecian</hi> Phalanges, who drew up their heavy armed Foot but eight deep, and ſo by our Authors method, their light armed but four deep; for if you allow their heavy armed Phalange to be one thouſand twenty four Files, theſe multiplied by eight, which is the number of the File, that Batallion conſiſted of eight thouſand one hundred ninety two men: Their Velites being half of that number, they were four thouſand nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix: Give the half of that number to their Cavalry, they muſt have been two thouſand forty eight. And thus by <hi>Aelians</hi> rule, their whole Phalange<note place="margin">Nor in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Grecian</hi> Phalanges.</note> of both heavy and light armed Foot and Horſe ſhould have amounted to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor leſs than fourteen thouſand three hundred thirty ſix Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.

At <hi>Delos,</hi> the <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Boeotians</hi> had an Army conſiſting of ſeven thouſand heavy armed Foot, ten thouſand light armed, and one thouſand Horſe.

                        </gap>das</hi> his Army conſiſted of thirty thouſand Foot, and three thouſand Horſe; a number exceeding the great <hi>Macedonian</hi> Phalange by four thouſand three hundred twenty eight men. The Armies of the <hi>Laced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>monians</hi> and <hi>Athenians</hi> that fought againſt him in that laſt Battel of his, were twenty two thouſand Foot and Horſe, and theſe were more by ſeven thouſand ſix hundred ſixty four, than a <hi>Grecian</hi> Phalange ſhould have been by <hi>Aelians</hi> method, at four deep the light, and eight deep the heavy armed, and yet came ſhort ſix thouſand ſix hundred ſeventy two of the number of the great <hi>Macedonian</hi> Phalange. By this we ſee our Authors num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Phalanges did not always hold; and it is a very great queſtion to me, if ever they did exactly hold at all.</p>
                  <p>I have already told you, how he marſhals his Phalange of heavy armed Foot, without Reſerve, I have ſhown you that was not always done, and I have demonſtrated and inſtanc'd the inconveniencies of it, when it was done; Let us now ſee where he placeth his Cavalry in time of action: To this he ſaith, it was marſhall'd according to the Generals pleaſure, ſometimes on the Flanks of the heavy armed Foot, ſometimes before them, and ſometimes behind them. That they were drawn up according to the Generals pleaſure, he needed not tell us, that was not the queſtion, but it was where the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals pleaſure was to place them. For marſhalling the Horſe on the Flanks of the Foot, there is reaſon enough for it; it was, and ſtill is a common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. To marſhal them when they are to fight before the Foot, is not, in<note place="margin">Where <hi>Aeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> marſhall'd the Cavalry.</note> my opinion, adviſedly done; ſome to skirmiſh doth well, but if all the Horſe fight in the Van of the Foot, and be beaten, they may readily rout their own Infantry, without the Enemies help, for ſomething like that I have ſeen pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd. And though the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Foot Phalange had, as I ſaid before, three Intervals, through which, the Horſe might perhaps (if worſted) have retir'd in good order, and drawn up in the Rear of the Foot, yet their Flight or Retreat would have infinitely diſcourag'd the Infantry, which was preſently to enter into action; nor do I think ſuch a manner of fight hath been oft practis'd. To draw up the Horſe behind the Foot would be, in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet of leſs uſe; but <hi>Aelian</hi> in his Figure of the whole Phalanx, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals the heavy armed Foot formoſt, next them the Velites, and the Cavalry behind both. If he did not intend the Horſe ſhould fight in that place, why did he marſhal them there; and if he conceiv'd they might fight there, why did he not tell us, how they could do it. It is true, it may be imagin'd, the Velites might beſtow their Arrows and Stones caſt out of Slings upon an
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97406:23"/> Enemy, over the heads of the heavy arm'd Phalange: but what hurt Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, heavily armed, could do an Enemy over the heads of both heavy and light arm'd Foot, drawn up in two diſtinct Bodies one behind the other, is not ſo eaſie to fanſie. And with permiſſion of <hi>Aelian,</hi> I doubt, it can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be made appear, that any General before his time, whether <hi>Macedonian, Grecian,</hi> or <hi>Barbarian,</hi> ever drew up an Army in that faſhion, if they had ground to do it otherwiſe. <hi>Cyrus</hi> plac'd his Foot in the Battel, and his Horſe in the<note place="margin">Ordinarily Horſe fought in the Wings.</note> Wings, when he fought with the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> ſaith <hi>Xenophon.</hi> The <hi>Grecians</hi> at <hi>Delos, Leuctra,</hi> and <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> put their Horſe in the Wings mixed with light armed Foot, their heavy armed Phalange in the middle, and ſome of their Velites skirmiſhing before it, with Reſerves behind. <hi>Alexander</hi> uſed that ſame cuſtome in all his Battels, though at <hi>Iſſus,</hi> the Streights of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains would not ſuffer him to put his Army in that order he had deſign'd, till he acquir'd a more ſpatious ground. At <hi>Arbela,</hi> where he totally overthrew <hi>Darius,</hi> he marſhall'd his Army nothing after <hi>Aelians</hi> pattern; but ſo, that you may almoſt ſay, that our Modern Generals draw up their Armies now in imitation of him, and according to the Copy he caſt them there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For his Right Wing conſiſted of Horſe mix'd with light armed Foot, the Right hand whereof was commanded by <hi>Clitus,</hi> and the Left by <hi>Philotas.</hi> His Left Wing was likewiſe Horſe mix'd with Velites, on the Right hand whereof ſtood <hi>Meleager,</hi> and on the Left, <hi>Philip</hi> with his <hi>Theſſalian</hi> Cavalry. Between theſe two Wings was ranged his Phalange of heavy arm'd Foot, ſome Velites skirmiſhing before it, and behind all theſe, both Phalanae and Wings, were thoſe Reſerves, under <hi>Horeſtes, Lincerta, Polycarpon</hi> and <hi>Philagus;</hi> whereof I formerly told you.</p>
                  <p>The altering a Phalange from one form, poſture, or ſite to another, gave<note place="margin">Several forms of a Phalange gave it ſeveral denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> occaſion to the <hi>Grecians</hi> to give it ſome new denomination, though it was ſtill that ſame Phalange, it was before the motion or evolution made the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which perhaps hath given a rice to <hi>Aelian</hi> to preſent us with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeveral Figures in his Treatiſe; nor would they be hard to be underſtood, if they were illuſtrated by either ſmaller or greater Bodies in the Field, as they are by him in Paper.

                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the <hi>Grecian</hi> March, Baggage, Encamping, Guards, and of their <hi>Paean.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ALL theſe belong to the Art of War of any Nation and none will doubt, but the <hi>Grecians</hi> had ſet rules and orders for them all, and every one of them, which they did not alter, but according to the circumſtances of things and emergency of affairs, on which depend moſt of Military actions. <hi>Aelian</hi> gives us little light, or indeed none at all, in any of theſe particulars,<note place="margin">Moſt of them forgot by <hi>Aelian.</hi>
                     </note> but leaves us to glean what we can out of Hiſtory, and thereon to build our own conjectures.</p>
                  <p>It had been convenient for us to have known the manner of their marching, where or how the Horſe, the heavy and light armed, and how far every day all of them were obliged to march, as alſo whether the Chiliarchies (which were Regiments of Foot) and the Hipparchies (which were Regiments of<note place="margin">March.</note> Horſe) changed day about, or if they march'd conſtantly in one place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Antiquity or Precedency. For there is no doubt but their Ephipparchies (which were Brigades of Horſe; and their Myriarchies (which were Brigades of Foot) might have chang'd Van and Rear every day by turns, as eaſily as our Brigades do. But ſince we are left by our leader <hi>Aelian</hi> in the dark, I ſhall be of the opinion, that being there were by <hi>Aeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> account four Ephipparchies in the Cavalry, and four Phalangarchies in the Phalange of the heavy armed Foot, they chang'd day about, and each of them had the Van every fourth day; as alſo, I think, it was moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentaneous to Reaſon, that there being four Chiliarchies in every Phalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy, and four Talentinarchies in every Ephipparchy, they likewiſe daily changed; ſo that every Talentinarchy had the Van in the Ephipparchy every fourth day, as every Chiliarchy had in the Phalangarchy. I ſhall likewiſe believe, that the Cavalry march'd either before, behind, or on the Flanks of the Foot Phalange, according to the Enemies motions, and ſo did the light armed Foot. By theſe conjectures I do not offer to impoſe on any mans belief, but leave him that liberty that I have taken, to gueſs as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably as he can. How far the heavy armed Phalange was bound to march in one day, as I can aſſert nothing, ſo I may only gueſs, that they could be bound to march but twenty or five and twenty miles, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Legio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries were, and therefore I can hardly believe <hi>Polianus,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Philip</hi> made his Phalange march in one day three hundred <hi>Stadia</hi> or Furlongs, which make thirty ſeven <hi>Italian</hi> miles and a half, you will think this the more incredible, when you hear immediately what Baggage they carried.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Baggage of a <hi>Grecian</hi> Army, our Author gives us this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; firſt, that it was neceſſary to appoint a judicious and active perſon to have the conduct of it, he ſaith well: Next he tells us, that ſometimes the Baggage march'd in the Van of the Army, and ſo I think it ſhould if the<note place="margin">Baggage.</note> Enemy were in the Rear. Sometimes, ſaith he, it march'd in the Rear, when the Army advanc'd towards an Enemy, and good reaſon it ſhould be ſo. Sometimes, ſaith he, it march'd in the middle of the Army, and there may be ſtrong enough Reaſons for that too. But ſometimes he ſaith, it was order'd to march in the Flanks of the Army, and ſo it might, provided it had good Guards on the Flanks of it. And laſtly, he avers, the <hi>Grecians</hi> ſent their Baggage ſometimes before their Army, when they were to enter iuto a declared Enemies Countrey. And here, I profeſs, I do not at all underſtand the myſtery of this Stratagem of War. But I wiſh <hi>Aelian</hi> had clear'd us in this, whether the Souldiers or Companies of Horſe or Foot,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97406:24"/> had Waggons, Carts, Beaſts of Carriage, Drudges and Slaves allow'd them to carry their Meat and Drink, and Fardles, or if they were obliged to carry all, themſelves; for in my next Eſſay of the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia, I ſhall let you ſee a Legionary carry three Magazines on his Head, Back, and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the firſt of Arms, Stakes or Palliſadoes; the ſecond of Meat and Clothes; and the third of Utenſils for a Kitchin. If of all theſe three, the <hi>Greek</hi> was only obliged to carry his Arms, he had a great advantage of the <hi>Roman</hi> in all marches and expeditions. Yet, I ſuppoſe, my Reader may hazard with me to believe, that before <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedons</hi> time, the <hi>Grecian</hi> Souldiers carried no other burthens than their Arms, but had<note place="margin">The <hi>Grecian</hi> Souldiers car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd no Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,</note> either Carriage-Beaſts or Drudges allow'd them, for carrying their Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and other neceſſaries; and this conjecture I ground upon what I have read in <hi>Thucydides,</hi> who tells us, that at <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> after the unfortunate <hi>Athenians</hi> had loſt their Navy, in which were all or moſt of their proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that they were to march away by Land from the Siege of that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent City to ſeek new fortunes, their Souldiers were neceſſitated to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their meat themſelves; becauſe, ſaith the Hiſtorian, they had moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt their Slaves and Drudges who were accuſtom'd to carry it; and ſome few, whoſe Slaves had ſtay'd ſtill with them, durſt not truſt them with ſo precious a thing as meat then was, leſt in that ſad diſaſter they ſhould run away with it, and ſo ſtarve them. If then their Slaves ran away from<note place="margin">Till <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedons</hi> time.</note> them, then Slaves were allow'd them. And it ſeems King <hi>Philip</hi> abrogated this cuſtome, for he caus'd all his Foot Souldiers to carry their Meat and Baggage themſelves, allowing only one Soujat to carry a Hand-mill for the uſe of ten Souldiers, and a Drudge to every Horſe-man; this caus'd the other <hi>Grecians</hi> to call the <hi>Philippians, Jumenta Philippi, Philips</hi> Beaſts of Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. But for all that, I have not Faith enough to believe <hi>Frontinus,</hi> who ſaith, that the ſame <hi>Philip</hi> caus'd his Foot to carry at one time <hi>Triginta die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum farinam,</hi> meal for thirty days. And if his Son <hi>Alexander</hi> kept up that cuſtome, as it is like he did, then his Phalangites needed not to have yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Legionaries for heavy burthens in both long and weariſome marches, which you will eaſily grant to be true, if you will conſider the indefatigable expeditions of that magnanimous King through <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>India.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems <hi>Aelian</hi> hath not thought Caſtrametation a ſubject pertinent to his<note place="margin">Caſtrametati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Treatiſe, for he ſpeaks nothing of it, and yet it is a very conſiderable part of the Art of War. I find the <hi>Grecians</hi> did not put their Souldiers to ſo much fatigue, as to fortifie their Camp every night, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did. They choſe their Caſtrametation to be in places of advantage, on Heights, Hills, or Riſing grounds, or where they might have a River or Water as their Back, or one of their Flanks, and if they had theſe, or any of theſe, they uſed to caſt up but a ſlight Retrenchment, unleſs they were to encamp ſome long time. Sometimes the Figure of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Camp was Oval, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times equilateral Square, ſometimes Oblong, and I have read that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> appointed his <hi>Spartan</hi> Camps to be round, if they could have none of thoſe advantages I ſpoke of; the defect of that Figure is, that it wants Flanks, which ſhould not be wanting in any Fortification; but it had the advantage of other Figures, that it could contain more than any of them, becauſe, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunda eſt omnium Figurarum capaciſſima.</hi> If it be true, what ſome ſay, that the <hi>Romans</hi> learn'd their Art of Encamping from <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epirus,</hi> then we ſhall know what his or the <hi>Grecian</hi> manner was, when I come to ſpeak of the Caſtrametation of the <hi>Romans,</hi> where we ſhall ſee, if he was their Maſter, he needed not be aſham'd of ſuch Scholars. This <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> was Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> Son to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who was a great Captain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a far greater Captain, the famous <hi>Alexander;</hi> who, no queſtion, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Art of Encamping very well. We read, that the very day he fought his laſt Battel with <hi>Darius</hi> at <hi>Arbela,</hi> upon ſight of that numerous<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Alexanders</hi> Camp at <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bela.</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97406:25"/> to give Battel, he commanded the Retrenchment to be caſt down, that his Batallions might march out in Breaſt. All this being done in a very ſhort time, ſhows that his Army was well acquainted with both Caſtrame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Fortifidation.</p>
                  <p>To know how the <hi>Grecians</hi> kept their Watches and Guards, we muſt expect no light from <hi>Aelian,</hi> who ſpeaks nothing at all of that affair. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he hath been of one opinion with that Anabaptiſt Miniſter, who preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on that Text, <hi>Watch and Pray,</hi> told his Audience, He would not trouble them with the various Interpretations of the word <hi>Watch,</hi> for he would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them, in few words, that <hi>Watch,</hi> was as much as to ſay <hi>Watch.</hi> But becauſe I have not read of any eſſential differences between the <hi>Roman</hi> Guards and Watches, and thoſe of the ancient <hi>Grecians,</hi> I ſhall refer my Reader to my diſcourſe of both, in the twenty ſecond Chapter of my <hi>Eſſays of the</hi> Roman <hi>Art of War,</hi> where I ſhall inform him of any obſervable thing concerning them, mention'd by <hi>Aeneas,</hi> in thoſe fragments of his, which all-devouring time hath left us, and thoſe are but few.</p>
                  <p>Before the <hi>Grecians</hi> began their Battels they ſung their <hi>Paean,</hi> which was<note place="margin">

                  <p>By what I have ſaid, you may eaſily perceive how little, I think, we have learn'd of the moſt eſſential points of the Ancient <hi>Grecian</hi> Militia, from this great, and ſo much talk'd of Maſter of the Art of War, <hi>Aelian.</hi> And if any ſay, he only undertook to acquaint the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> with the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalling <hi>Grecian</hi> Battels, I ſhall ſay firſt, that he hath but very ill acquitted himſelf of that undertaking; and next, that he might have done that great Prince as great a favour to have inform'd hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:97406:25"/>
                  <p>Since the time that the <hi>Switzer</hi> Cantons confederated ſo ſtrongly, and<note place="margin">Switzers.</note> fought with their Maſters ſo fortunately, that they got themſelves declar'd Free States, their great Batallions of ten, ſometimes twelve, ſometimes ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand (all arm'd for the Offenſive, with long and ſtrong Pikes) and having their Heads, Necks, Backs, Breaſts, Bellies, and Arms and Thighs well defended with Iron and Steel, reſembled perfectly a <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Phalange of heavy armed Foot. And what great Victories they gain'd with thoſe Batallions ſhall be ſpoke of hereafter en paſſant. But one hundred years ago, and before that, they came ſhort of the <hi>Grecians</hi> for their Velites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we read not, that then they made uſe of any Muſque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s, though other Nations did. But not long after that time they began to follow the cuſtome of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who then, and long after, made up their Bodies of Foot of two thirds of Pikes, and one third of Fire-men. For to arm two parts of a Company of Foot with Muſquets, and one part with Pikes, is a cuſtome of a far later date. But of this more in another place. Upon the whole matter, I ſay, that our Infantry of Muſqueteers and Pike-men, (if they be well arm'd for the Defenſive) reſembles the <hi>Grecian</hi> heavy and light armed Foot, and ſo do our Cuiraſſiers and Light Horſe repreſent their Cataphracts and light armed Horſe. I wonder why the <hi>Turks</hi> pretend that their Janizaries repreſent the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Foot Phalange of heavy armed; for carrying Guns, Half-Pikes, and Javelines, they come far ſhort of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lange, in the ſtrength whereof the <hi>Macedonians</hi> (as they had reaſon) put their greateſt truſt. But if theſe Infidels be not guilty of greater crimes than of vain oſtentation, I think, as good Chriſtians, we are bound to forgive them.</p>
                  <p>But ſince the time that Gun-powder made a loud noiſe in the world, I do not read of any <hi>Europ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This Army of his is very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly deſcrib'd by a Noble Author, who, though he conceal his name, yet, as his writings ſpeak him to be an excellent Hiſtorian, ſo they bewray him to have been a Commander in the Wars, both in that Kings time, and in the Reigns of all his three Sons. By the relation of it, we will ſee how both the <hi>French</hi> Infantry and Cavalry were mounted and armed, and how their Batalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were marſhall'd about one hundred and twenty years ago.</p>
                  <p>His Foot was marſhall'd by his Great Conſtable <hi>Monmorancy,</hi> in three Batal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions: One conſiſted of <hi>Germans,</hi> whoſe number was ſeven thouſand, and<note place="margin">His <hi>Germans.</hi>
                     </note> therefore I conclude them to have been two Regiments, each conſiſting of twelve Companies, and each Company of three hundred men or thereabout, according to the cuſtome obſerved then, and long after, by that Nation. They were arm'd Defenſively as the <hi>French</hi> were; but for Offence, two parts<note place="margin">How arm'd;</note> of them had Pikes, and the third part Harquebuſſes. They were commanded by the Rhinegrave, whom moſt of the <hi>French</hi> Hiſtorians call very vitiouſly, and almoſt ridiculouſly Count of <hi>Rhingrave,</hi> which is as much as Earl of <hi>Rhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>His <hi>French</hi> Infantry was divided into two great Batallions: The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted<note place="margin">His <hi>French</hi> Foot,</note> of fifteen thouſand fighting men, of theſe nine thouſand were heavy armed, and ſix thouſand were light armed. The nine thouſand had for their Defenſive Arms, Head pieces, Backs and Breaſts, Gantlets, Sleeves and Taſlets; for the Offenſive, they had Swords, and long <hi>Bois,</hi> under which name you are to comprehend Pikes, Halberds, Partiſans, and long Staves,<note place="margin">How arm'd.</note> banded and pointed with Iron, and moſt of them all had Piſtols at their Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles. The other ſix thouſand of the firſt Batallion, who were light armed, had for Armour, rich Morrions, and Jacks and Sleeves of Mail, and for Weapons, they had Swords and Harquebuſſes for the moſt part, and ſome Musquets, all bright, clear, and fixed. The ſecond <hi>French</hi> Batallion of Foot was compoſed of thoſe who were brought out of the Southern Provinces of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97406:26"/> 
                     <hi>France,</hi> and it was ten thouſand ſtrong, whereof ſeven were heavy armed, and the other three thouſand light armed, they were armed much as the firſt Batallion was.</p>
                  <p>His Cavalry was ſub-divided into <hi>Gens d'Arms,</hi> Archers, Light Horſe-men,<note place="margin">His Cavalry.</note> and Harquebuſiers: His Cuiraſſiers or <hi>Gens d'Arms,</hi> conſiſting all of perſons of noble Families, were about one thouſand, admirably well mounted on <hi>French</hi> Courſers, <hi>Turkey</hi> Horſes, or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gennets. They were ſtrongly and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily arm'd for the Defenſive; for Offence, they had each a Lance, a Mace,<note place="margin">Gens d'Arms.</note> and a Sword, no word here of a Piſtol. Their Horſes were arm'd with Bards and Plates of Braſs, richly capariſon'd; and many other Horſes they had, on which (beſide their led Horſes) their Servants, Pages, and Grooms rede. The Captains and other Officers of theſe <hi>Gens d'Arms</hi> were in rich Armour gilded and curiouſly wrought, mounted they were on couragious<note place="margin">How mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Horſes, who were arm'd and richly capariſon'd, and their Harneſs cover'd with either Velvet or Cloath of Tiſſue, with Gold-ſmith work or Embroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery. Every one of theſe <hi>Gens d'Arms</hi> had an Archer, who followed him,<note place="margin">Archers.</note> by the <hi>French</hi> conſtitutions of War, who though then they uſed neither Bow nor Arrow (as formerly they did) yet did ſtill retain the name of Archers. They rode on ſmall, but very nimble Horſes, who vaulted pleaſantly; each of them carried a Lance, a Piſtol, and a Sword, all of them well accoutred, ſtriving who ſhould appear fineſt. The Light Horſe-men were mounted on<note place="margin">Light Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> good Nags, little, but very ſwift; for Armour, they had light Helmets, Corſlets, and Sleeves; for Offenſive Arms, each of them had a Cutlace, and either a half Lance, or a Piſtol, which of them he pleas'd, but not both. Of theſe Light Horſe there were about eighteen hundred. The Harquebuſiers were mounted on as good Geldings as they could make themſelves maſters of;<note place="margin">Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers.</note> they had Jacks, Morrions, and Sleeves of Mail for Defence; their Weapons were Swords, and Harquebuſſes of three foot long, hanging at the courches of their Saddles. He had about fifteen hundred of them.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all theſe, there were about four hundred <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen, all Volunteers, under the command of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lord; they were mounted on<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Engliſh</hi> Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers.</note> handſome and ſwift Geldings; they were provided with little Armour for Defence; their Weapons were Swords and Lances, like Half-Pikes, ſaith our Author. Theſe were King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Forces.</p>
                  <p>Setting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> aſide, we have of <hi>French</hi> Cavalry, one thouſand <hi>Gens d'Arms,</hi> one thouſand Archers, eighteen hundred Light Horſe, and fifteen hundred Harquebuſiers: Add theſe together, the aggregate is five thouſand three hundred. This exceeds the number of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by one thouſand one hundred and eight. In the next place, ſet the Rhingrave and his <hi>German</hi> Foot aſide, the heavy arm'd <hi>French</hi> Foot were ſixteen thouſand, which wanted but three hundred eighty four of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> heavy armed Phalange. The <hi>French</hi> light armed Foot were about nine thouſand, which was eight hundred and eight more than <hi>Aelian</hi> allows to the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites. The <hi>French</hi> Foot and Horſe amounted to thirty thouſand three hundred Combatants, thoſe of <hi>Aelians</hi> great Phalange to twenty eight thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſeventy two; the difference is ſixteen hundred twenty eight. But if we reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Volunteers, the Kings own Guards of <hi>Scots, French,</hi>

                  <p>The Author tells us, that King <hi>Henry</hi> view'd this mighty Army of his near the City of <hi>Metz,</hi> where he ſaith it was drawn up in Battalia; but he forgot<note place="margin">A great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight.</note> to inform us here of two very conſiderable points; the one, of what alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or depth both the Foot and Horſe were; the ſecond, what diſtances were kept, or order'd to be kept, between the ſeveral Files and Ranks both of Horſe and Foot, and how great the Intervals were between the ſeveral Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions and Bodies, as well of the Cavalry as the Infantry; for thereby we ſhould have been able not only to have made a probable conjecture, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately to have known, how much ground the whole Army took up in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97406:26"/> longitude, but there are others who are guilty of this neglect as well as this Author of ours, who hath fail'd in this.</p>
                  <p>With theſe, indeed formidable Forces, did the <hi>French</hi> King intend to defie, and fight within the Bowels of the <hi>German</hi> Empire. <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, a greater and braver Prince than whom (though he had not been elected Emperour of the <hi>Romans</hi>) either for propriety and large extent of Patrimonial Dominions, or for perſonal Courage and Prudence, the Weſtern World had not ſeen ſince the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great.

And at length <hi>Henry</hi>'s great preparations came to nothing, for the two <hi>German</hi> Princes having (not without ſome ſtain to their Honour) made their Peace with the Emperour, without the <hi>French</hi> Kings privity, he was glad to return, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his own Territories againſt <hi>Charles,</hi> who was horribly incens'd againſt him, for offering to aſſiſt his Rebels (for ſo he call'd thoſe Electors) againſt his Lawful Authority.</p>

Truly I think, that not any one part of that <hi>Florentines</hi> Writings ſmells ranker of Atheiſm than this doth. But <hi>Polybius,</hi> an univerſally approv'd Author, ſpeaks very near<note place="margin">Polybius.</note> the ſame language in the ſixth Book of his Hiſtory, where he ſaith, that that which with other Nations was accounted a Vice, was made uſeful by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> for keeping their Subjects within the bounds of their duty; and that was, ſaith he, the ſuperſtitious veneration of their Gods in an extraordinary way; but withal he adds, that the <hi>Romans</hi> did well to reſtrain the fury and other paſſions of the Commons with unſeen terrours, with feign'd and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bug-bears, and that both they, and other Ancient Nations had done pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to induce in credulous minds the opinion of Deities, and of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell; and though theſe have no exiſtency, yet the Doctrine of them, ſaith he, is not to be raſhly condemn'd, ſince it over-awes the vulgar. Whether this Diſcourſe will not prove <hi>Polybius</hi> (though he knew not the true God) to have been in that Idolatrous age, wherein he lived, as very an Atheiſt, as <hi>Machiavelli</hi> was, when he wrote his Diſcourſes on <hi>Livy,</hi> and his Book <hi>Di Prencipe,</hi> I ſhall not determine, but leave thoſe who accuſe him of that crime, and his Tranſlator <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> who defends him from that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, to debate the matter between them.</p>

                  <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe inward Maladies, enough to have conſumed the vitals of any State, the <hi>Romans</hi> in time prevailed over all thoſe, with whom they made either a juſt or an unjuſt War: for as the all-powerful God had pre-ordained them to be a mighty people, ſo he had qualified them with parts, abilities, and endowments, to attain to that greatneſs: Theſe were, True Fortitude, Prudence, Abſtinence, Temperance, Equity (either real or<note place="margin">

And yet he profeſſed, that he thought he had done the <hi>Roman</hi> Republick the greateſt ſervice, in preſerving their Military Art from Oblivion, and tranſmitting it to poſterity by his Writings. There is no queſtion, but that Treatiſe of his, if it had not been loſt, had clear'd us of many of thoſe doubts and difficulties, which none that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant do or ever will do.

                  <p>THE great Bulk or Body of the <hi>Roman</hi> State was divided into three<note place="margin">Three Orders in the <hi>Roman</hi> State.</note> Principal Members; theſe were, the <hi>Patritian,</hi> the <hi>Equeſtral,</hi> and the <hi>Plebeian.</hi> Out of the firſt were choſen the Senators, Dictators, Conſuls, Pro-Conſuls, Praetors and Pro-Praetors; till the Commons, after long ſtrife, wrong from the <hi>Patritians</hi> the priviledge to have a <hi>Plebeian</hi> Conſul, and other Magiſtrates. Out of the <hi>Equeſtral</hi> Order were all their Horſe-men levied, ſo that all of the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry were Gentlemen, which cuſtome was followed<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men all Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen.</note> by many Nations for many ages, but is now well near worn out. The <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe-men were choſen by the Cenſors. Of the <hi>Plebeians</hi> or Commons were the Foot Souldiers elected. <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſaith, that the Countrey-fellows were rather choſen, than thoſe bred in Cities; and in the perſons who were to be elected, he doth not ſo much require bigneſs or talneſs of Body, (as <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> did) as the largeneſs of their Breaſts, the vivacity of their Eyes, the brawni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Arms and Legs. He makes choice rather of Artificers and Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<note place="margin">Foot Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>Plebeians.</hi>
                     </note> than Merchants, but of theſe he rejects Fiſhers, Fowlers, Clothiers, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioners, and all ſuch whoſe Trades are ſedentary; and hereby he excludes Taylors and Shoomakers, (but I have known good Souldiers of both) for all theſe he eſteems womanly: But he admits Hunters, Hawkers, Smiths, Carpenters, and ſuch as they. This upon the matter is all <hi>Vegtius</hi> tells us of the <hi>Roman</hi> Levy.</p>
                  <p>Other Authors ſhew us the manner of their Levy, which was this: Every<note place="margin">Manner of the <hi>Roman</hi> levy.</note> year when the Conſuls were elected, four Legions were levied, (unleſs ſome extraordinary occaſion requir'd more) that was two for every Conſul, which with as many from the Allies, made up two Conſular Armies. At that time did all the Tribes appear, which in the flouriſhing condition of the <hi>Romans</hi> came to be thirty five. In the firſt place, twenty four Tribunes or Colonels were choſen, whereof fourteen were of the <hi>Equeſtral,</hi> and ten of the popular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Suppoſe ſtill, that four Legions were to be rais'd, for if either more or leſs, the number of the Tribunes was augmented or diminiſh'd. <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſaith, that ſix Tribunes were conſtantly ordain'd for every Legion, whatever ſtrength it was of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by his favour, <hi>Livy</hi> tells us in his Ninth Book, that there were but four Tribunes in every Legion in the War againſt the <hi>Samnites:</hi> And at that time the Tribunes were choſen by the Tribes, and from thence they have their denomination; and I find likewiſe they were choſen by the Tribes in the time of the Second Punick War, but in the <hi>Macedonian</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls had the election of them. Two years after that War was ended, <hi>Livy</hi> informs us, the Tribes reſum'd their former liberty, and elected their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes.</p>
                  <p>The manner in which the Tribunes or Colonels elected their Souldiers was<note place="margin">How the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions were elected.</note> this: Every Tribe divided its men that were fit for ſervice, by fours: Of the firſt four, the eldeſt Tribune of the firſt Legion choſe one, the eldeſt Tribune of the ſecond Legion choſe the ſecond; the eldeſt Tribune of the third Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on choſe the third, and the fourth man fell to the lot of the eldeſt Tribune of the fourth Legion. Of the ſecond four, the firſt Tribune of the ſecond Legion choſe the firſt. Of the third four, the firſt Tribune of the third Legion choſe the firſt. And of the fourth four, the firſt Tribune of the fourth Legion choſe the firſt; and ſo again alternatively, till the Legions were all compleat; and the election for all the four Legions as equally made as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly it could be. Thoſe who were elected, were not always <hi>Tirones</hi> or <hi>Novitiates,</hi> for many of them had ſerv'd in the Wars before, but were ſtill oblig'd to be enroll'd at new levies (if elected) till they had ſerv'd out that time that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97406:31"/> was appointed, and what that was, ſhall be immediately told you. Thoſe who were levied for the Foot ſervice, were ordinarily divided into four Claſſes: In the firſt were the moſt experimented, and were call'd <hi>Triarii;</hi> in the ſecond thoſe of the ſtrongeſt Bodies, and had the name of <hi>Principes;</hi> in the third were thoſe who were in their youthful years, and had leaſt experience, and were called <hi>Haſtati;</hi> in the fourth Claſs were thoſe who were ordain'd to be light armed, and had the name of <hi>Velites.</hi> Of all theſe, and every one of them, I ſhall ſpeak particularly in the ſixth Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The Tribunes had the power alſo to chooſe the Centurions, the Standard,<note place="margin">How the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers were elected.</note> Enſign, and Eagle-bearers, but not according to their own pleaſure, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time they had ſerv'd, the degrees they had attain'd to, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natives they had got, and the ſervices they had done; and if any of them conceiv'd he got wrong, he had power to appeal from the Tribune to the Conſul. Obſerve here, that no man could be choſen to be an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, but he who had ſerv'd out half his time, which was this: The Horſe-men were oblig'd to ſerve ten years, and the Foot twenty, (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſtill, that they were not mutilated, or made unſerviceable in the Wars) after that, they were <hi>Emeriti Milites,</hi> and were to get their Dimiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;<note place="margin">How long a <hi>Roman</hi> Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was bound to ſerve.</note> and this ſometimes occaſion'd Mutinies, when the State could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently ſpare them. The members elected for the War, were not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſeventeen years old, nor above forty ſeven. But it is ſtrange, how <hi>Vegetius</hi> in the fourteenth Chapter of his Firſt Book, againſt the current of all Writers, affirms, that thoſe of fourteen years old ſhould be brought to the election, if the ancient cuſtome, ſaith he, were obſerv'd. But theſe Dimiſſions were ſometimes diſpenced with, when Reaſon of State required it: And <hi>Livy</hi> ſaith, that in the <hi>Macedonian</hi> War there was no Ceſſation from Arms, nor Dimiſſions granted, but to thoſe who were paſt the fiftieth year of their age.</p>
                  <p>If any abſented themſelves from the time and place ordain'd for election, they were puniſh'd; but how, neither <hi>Polybius</hi> nor <hi>Vegetius</hi> tell us. But <hi>Lipſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Abſents from elections how puniſh'd.</note> that great Inveſtigator of Antiquity, out of Hiſtory informs us, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they were fin'd in Money, or Beſtial; ſometimes they had all or moſt of their goods taken from them; ſome of them were corporally puniſh'd by bonds and impriſonment, ſome of them had whipping with Rods, and ſome had their Fingers and Thumbs cut off, and many of them were ſold for Slaves. He ſaith alſo, that ſome perſons were appointed (whom he calls <hi>Conquiſitores</hi>) to ſearch out, and find ſuch Delinquents. But in proceſs of time, eſpecially after the <hi>Roman</hi> State was converted into a Monarchy, this laudable and ſtrict way of election wore out, and decay'd; and inſtead of free born, and of the luſtieſt and ableſt <hi>Plebeians,</hi> Soujats, Slaves, Drudges, and the Servants of Vintners and Cooks were elected and enroll'd, to the diſgrace of the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia, and ſubverſion of the Empire; whereof <hi>Vegetius</hi> hath juſt reaſon to complain.</p>
                  <p>Two things my Reader muſt obſerve here; firſt, that beſides this formal<note place="margin">Tumultuary levies.</note> election, there was a ſudden and tumultuary levy, which was made when the danger was great, the Enemy prevail'd, or other Emergencies, or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of State required expedition. In theſe caſes, no reſpect was had to Age or Dimiſſions, but all, young and old (provided they were fit for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) were enroll'd, and forc'd to take Arms in defence of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. The ſecond thing to be obſerved, is, that though moſt Authors ſay, that ſo long as the <hi>Roman</hi> State kept up its Ancient and ſtrict diſcipline, (this ſome will have to have been done till the time of the Emperours) all the <hi>Roman</hi> levies, whether formal or tumultuary, were all made of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, notwithſtanding, I ſay, this aſſertion, Hiſtory tells us, that that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Nation did not tye it ſelf ſo ſtrictly to that point of Honour; but both could, and did diſpence with it, when the Senators thought fit. For after the defeat at <hi>Cannae,</hi> they bought eight thouſand Slaves from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and enroll'd and armed them, who thereafter for their good ſervice done at <hi>Beneventum,</hi> were manumitted.

Some Authors ſay, the Horſe-men carried like wiſe ſome Darts,<note place="margin">Offenſive Weapons.</note> which may be probable. <hi>Joſephus</hi> informs us, that they carried Lances, Long Swords, and two or three Darts within their Shields, the points whereof, he ſaith, were as long as that of a Lance; and the Lance had two points, one at each end. It might be ſo in <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s time, but the Ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe-men made uſe of no Darts. How the light Horſe-men were arm'd, I cannot tell you; many very probably ſay, that no light horſe were made uſe of till the time of the Emperours, and but a few of them at firſt; and if this be true, <hi>Vegece</hi> might have told us, how they were arm'd, ſince he liv'd under an Emperour.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> heavy armed Foot wore Head-pieces, Back, and Belly-pieces,<note place="margin">Foot heavy armed.</note> and Taſlets, all theſe of Iron or Braſs: They had likewiſe Iron Boots, but how many is a queſtion. <hi>Polybius</hi> ſeems to allow them two, for he ſpeaks of Boots in the plural number. <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſaith, they had each but one Boot,<note place="margin">Their Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Armour.</note> which he affirms, they wore on their Right Legs.

He tells us of Shields, and that all the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97406:32"/> heavy armed Foot had Shields, but ſpeaks not of their form nor bigneſs.<note place="margin">A nice diſtin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction.</note> There be ſome, and among them <hi>Achilles Terduzzi,</hi> who make a difference between a Shield, and a Target; and it is this, the firſt was of a round figure, and the ſecond of a long, angular, or oval. If ſo, we muſt conclude thoſe uſed by the <hi>Romans</hi> to have been Targets and no Shields, in regard they were ordinarily four foot long, and two foot and a half broad. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this nice diſtinction, I ſhall uſe the word promiſcuouſly, and call the <hi>Roman</hi> Target a Shield. If we conſider, that there was an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of three foot of ground between the <hi>Roman</hi> Files, and that the breadth of their Shields covered two foot and a half of that ground, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, there was but one half foot left for them, firſt to throw their Jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines or Darts, and then to preſent the points of their Swords againſt their Enemies; and their Shields being ſo near each other, and their Bodies ſo ſtrongly defended by them and their other Armour, it is no wonder, they either gave or received a charge couragiouſly. For <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſaith well in the twentieth Chapter of his Firſt Book, that thoſe who are expoſed naked to receive Wounds, muſt think more of flying than fighting: And in the end of that ſame Chapter he ſaith, that he who hath his Head and Breaſt well arm'd, is not afraid of Wounds, and therefore needs not fear to fight.</p>
                  <p>As firſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Shields were made of Timber, Bulls-hides, or other Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">The <hi>Roman</hi> Shield.</note> artificially interwoven and wrought together, the Timber being ordinarily of the Fig or Willow-tree, cut in ſmall pieces, and all well cover'd with the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Leather: But <hi>Camillus</hi> having to do with the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who carried heavy ſlaſhing Swords, cauſed them to put a Margin or Border of Iron on the upper part of the Shield, thereby to reſiſt the force of their furious blows; and after <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> his time, there was a ſtrong-pointed piece of Iron put to the lower part of the Shield, upon which they fix'd it in the ground, either when they ſtood Centinel, or when they ſtood in Battel aray, expecting an Enemy, as <hi>Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> tells us in his Tenth Book, that in the great Battel fought by the <hi>Romans</hi> againſt the <hi>Samnites, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrians,</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> when both the <hi>Haſtati</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes</hi> were well near routed, ſome Tribunes coming with the <hi>Triarii</hi> to the reſcue, found the <hi>Gauls</hi> ſerr'd together in a <hi>Teſtudo,</hi> covering themſelves with their great Shields, in ſuch a manner, that the <hi>Roman Triarii</hi> (who were hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy arm'd) durſt not hazard on them, till firſt with Darts, Javelines, and other Miſſiles, they put them in diſorder, and then they routed them. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Second kind of a Tortoiſe.</note> tells us of the ſecond kind of the <hi>Teſtudo,</hi> made of Shields, at the aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Towns, the manner this: So many Centuries, Maniples, or Cohorts, as the Conſul or General pleas'd, ſtood near the Walls or Ports with their Shields over their heads, the firſt Rank ſtood ſtreight, the ſecond bowed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the third bowed a little more than the ſecond, the fourth more than the third, ſo ſtill declining, till the laſt Rank, (ſuppoſe the tenth) kneel'd. Up their Backs as up ſtairs, did thoſe who were ordain'd to ſtorm, run to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, and ſo either enter'd, or broke down places for others to enter. This, I believe, was practis'd often in their Plays on the Amphitheatres, and indeed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97406:33"/> it was more to be uſed in jeſt than in earneſt, for great Stones thrown down by the Defendants, would eaſily have broken the Tortoiſe-ſhell, and then molten Lead, boyling Oyl, or ſcalding Water (all ordinarily practis'd on ſuch occaſions by the Ancients) would, to my ſenſe, either ſoon have kill'd, or chac'd away the Tortoiſe it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>It is my opinion, that, when the <hi>Romans</hi> march'd, and no Enemy in ſight of them, they carried their Head-pieces at their girdles, and their Shields, within covers, on their Backs; my reaſon is, <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the Second Book of the <hi>Gallick</hi> War, ſaith, that the <hi>Nervians</hi> gave him ſo brisk and ſudden a a charge, that his Souldiers had not time enough to put on their Head-pieces, or pull their Shields out of their covers. And it was neceſſary they ſhould have been covered, for the preſervation of thoſe Devices and Coats of Arms that were Painted on them, a cuſtome uſed by ſeveral Nations before <hi>Romulus</hi> laid the foundation of <hi>Rome.</hi> But both before, and long after the <hi>Romans</hi> had over-maſter'd the habitable World, or moſt of it, men uſed to<note place="margin">Coats of Arms.</note> put on their Shields what fancies or devices they liked beſt, ſome Birds, ſome Beaſts of ſeveral kinds, ſome the noble actions of their Anceſtors, ſome the Sun, ſome the Moon, and ſome a leſſer Star. This, I ſuppoſe, gave the riſe to many of our Romance Writers, to give ſeveral denominations to all their Knights Errant, by the devices of their Shields, and to make them diſtinguiſhable thereby, when their faces were undiſcernable with the Beavors of their Helmets. But in after ages, Princes thought fit to reſtrain men from the vanity of taking Coats of Arms as they pleas'd, till they were given them by authority. Hence have the Heraulds their riſe, and if they were permitted to exerciſe their office ſtrictly, it is to be thought, we ſhould not ſee ſo many extravagant Coats in the World. I was acquainted long ago with a <hi>German</hi> (and there be many good Heraulds of that Nation) who had aſſum'd for his Coat the <hi>French</hi> Kings Arms; I ask'd him his reaſon for it, he told me, That his Chriſtian name was <hi>Louis,</hi> as well as that of the Moſt Chriſtian King, and ſince they had both one name, he knew not why they might not both have one Coat of Arms.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Head-pieces, as many think, were of Leather, till the time that the <hi>Gauls</hi> invaded their Seigneory; and then <hi>Camillus</hi> the Reſtorer of <hi>Rome,</hi> caus'd them to make them of Iron or Braſs, and indeed they had need of ſuch to reſiſt the mighty ſtroaks of thoſe ſtrong-bodied <hi>Barbarians.</hi> I find, their Helmets were tyed under their chins with claſps of Leather, Iron or Braſs; nor can I learn, that any other part of their face was either armed or covered, which, no doubt, mov'd <hi>Caeſar</hi> at <hi>Pharſalia</hi> to bid his Souldiers ſtrike at the ſaces of the <hi>Pompeyans,</hi> after they had caſt their Javelines. <hi>Miles, feri faciem,</hi> were ſaid to be his words. Upon their Helmets the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers had three<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Roman</hi> Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets.</note> Feathers, either Red or Black, ſtanding ſtreight up, one foot and a half high, ſaith <hi>Polybius;</hi> and thoſe ſeem'd to add, ſaith he, ſo much to their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Creſts.</note> and made a fine ſhew. Theſe Feathers were the common Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Creſts, but Commanders choſe for their Creſts ſuch things as beſt pleas'd their fancy; and by theſe they were known, as by the Devices of their Shields. As <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epirus;</hi> was known by his Creſt of Goate Horns.</p>
                  <p>Their Corſlet, Cataphract, Cuiras, or Back and Breaſt, (for all theſe are<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Roman</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlets.</note> one thing) was of Iron or Braſs, ſuch, ſay ſome Writers, that no Sword could pierce, much leſs a Dart or an Arrow: But this I will believe at full lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for the Great <hi>Alexander</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Gaza</hi> had his Body wounded with an Arrow, through his Corſlet, which I may rationally ſuppoſe to have been as good as ever any <hi>Roman</hi> Legionary wore; but we ſhall have more of this ſtuff anon. Some inſtead of a Corſlet had a Jack, made in that ſame faſhion as<note place="margin">Jacks of Mail.</note> Fronts, with Plates of Iron, and ſo artificially, that many wore them next their Shirts, with as much eaſe, ſay ſome, as we wear our Doublets. If I ſhould inform my Reader of a Corſlet made by a <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and preſented to <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> which a Javeline ſhot out of a Catapult could not pierce; perhaps he would believe it as little as I do my ſelf. It is writ of ſome who made Jacks<note place="margin">Jacks of Silk.</note> ſo well and ſo ſtrong of Linnen and Silk, that they could defend mens Bodies from Darts and Arrows, whereof ſome have been undertaken to be made
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:97406:33"/> in our time Piſtol proof. But here, let it be enough to know, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Corſlets ordinarily were of Iron and Braſs.</p>
                  <p>There is no queſtion, but the Sword was the Weapon of Offence, in which<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Roman</hi> Swords.</note> the Valorous <hi>Romans</hi> put their greateſt truſt, as that whereby they gain'd their moſt glorious Victories. <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirms, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Sword was of ſo well temper'd metal, that no Head, Back or Breaſt-piece was able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand its force, and their Helmets and Corſlets ſo ſtrong (as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)<note place="margin">Romantick.</note> that no Sword could pierce them. What ſhall I ſay then of all this, but that the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldier might be ſtout enough, ſince his Sword was irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable, and his Armour impenetrable. When I read all this fine Story, I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie them all to be Enchanted Knights, till I remember how the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> in many bloody bickerings open'd their Veins through the ſtrougeſt Fortification of their Harneſs. Or if this ſhould be deny'd me, yet, I hope, it will be granted, that <hi>Roman</hi> Swords could plerce <hi>Roman</hi> Corſlets, in their Civil Wars, where ſo many thouſands of them dyed by the edge of the Sword. <hi>Livy</hi> tells us, that after a ſcuffle between the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Macedonians, Perſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And yet, <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Roman</hi> Swords were made for pricking and thruſting, as well as for cutting, ſlaſhing, or cleaving; the Souldier was taught to uſe his Sword both ways, yea, thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was more and oftner uſed than the other, as that which gave Death ſooner than cutting did, and did not expoſe the Body of the Souldier to danger, ſo much as the other did. And it is certain enough, that at <hi>Pidna, Perſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They carried, he ſaith, their Swords on their right ſides, and ſo ſaith <hi>Polybius</hi> too; but where they carried their Daggers, none of them tells. But <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried their longeſt Sword on their Left ſide, and the ſhort one on the Right. Some Authors would perſwade us, that the <hi>Gauls</hi> carried Swords as long as<note place="margin">Romantick Swords.</note> the Spears of other Nations, and that the points of their Spears were as long as other mens Swords. <hi>Livy</hi> ſays not ſo much, but he writes, that they had very terrible Darts.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe the <hi>Roman Pilum</hi> was not properly a Dart, I ſhall Engliſh it, as <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vius</hi>

But we need not believe him in any of theſe aſſertions.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97406:34"/> had caſt his Javeline, to run to the ſhock, which accordingly they did.

When they ſtood in order of Battel, they us'd to ſtick their Javelines in the ground, till the ſign was given; ſo it ſeems they were ſharp at both ends, and no doubt, in time of Battel they might have made a Palliſado of them againſt Horſe, as <hi>Suediſh</hi> Feathers have been uſed in our time, yet we read not in Hiſtory, that any ſuch uſe was ever made of the <hi>Roman Pilum.</hi>

                  <p>Being now to ſpeak of the <hi>Roman</hi> light armed foot, I ſhall deſire my Reader once for all to take notice, that <hi>Vegetius</hi> was deſir'd by the Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> to give him the Conſtitutions, Laws and Practice of the Ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Art of War, and not of any cuſtoms lately crept in: Notwithſtanding which he reckons among the light armed Foot, <hi>Plumbati,</hi> whom he likewiſe calls <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiobarbuli,</hi> and <hi>Fuſtubularii,</hi> whom I cannot Engliſh otherwiſe, than the firſt to be Lead-caſters, and the ſecond to be Slingers with Battoons: He reckons alſo Archers, but in Ancient Hiſtory we do not read of any of thoſe three, for the old <hi>Romans</hi> acknowledg'd no other light arm'd or <hi>Velites,</hi> but Slingers<note place="margin">Roman Velites.</note> and Darters. Both theſe were armed Defenſively with Head-pieces of Raw-Hides, and a Target four handful long, and of an oval form. For Offence,<note place="margin">How arm'd.</note> the Darter had a Sword, and ſeven Darts; the Slinger had a Sling, a Sword, and a number of Stones. Some allow alſo to both of them a little Javeline of three or four foot long. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Darts being wing'd at the point, could hardly be pull'd out of a Shield, or the Body of a man; ſuch Arrows are common, and are called Barbed. But the <hi>Sagumine</hi> Dart, which was called <hi>Falarica,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves<note place="margin">The <hi>Saguntine Falarica.</hi>
                     </note> to be taken notice of. <hi>Livius</hi> deſcribes it thus in his twenty firſt Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Falarica</hi> was a kind of Dart uſed by the <hi>Saguntines,</hi> when <hi>Hannibal</hi> beſieg'd their City, (perhaps they invented it at that ſiege<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) it had a long ſhaft, round and even every where, except toward the end of it, and that was headed with Iron, three foot long, Tow being wrapp'd about it, ſmear'd with Pitch; this Tow they fired, when they were to lance the Dart, the violent motion increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the fire, inſomuch, as when it could not pierce the Body, it forc'd the Souldier to caſt away his Shield or Corſlet, and ſo expos'd him diſarm'd to the Darts or Arrows which were ſhot afterward. The Timber of the <hi>Roman</hi> Dart<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Roman</hi> Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> might be two foot long, and the bigneſs of a mans finger; the point of it of Iron, one foot long, ſharp, ſmall and ſubtile, that it might pierce, and in piercing bow, that ſo an Enemy might not make uſe of it, by throwing it back again, but this was the practice of other Nations as well as the <hi>Romans;</hi> yet I pray, obſerve what <hi>Livy</hi> ſaith in contradiction of this. In that Battel, which I mention'd but a little before, the <hi>Triarii</hi> gather'd up all the Darts (for they were allow'd to carry none of their own) which were ſtrayed all over the field, and, no doubt, had been all caſt before, and with theſe they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd the <hi>Gauls</hi> (who had made a Pent-houſe of their Shields) and ſo put them to flight. What ſhall we then believe? And is it not ſtrange too, that theſe Darters would throw their Darts four hundred foot; for my part, I dare not believe it, and if it be true, certainly the blow could not be mortal.</p>

                     <hi>Vegetius</hi> hath reaſon to prefer the Sling to the Bow, in this regard, that an Arrow cannot wound unleſs it pierce, but a Stone bruiſeth though it pierce not, and if it be of any weight, it killeth, notwithſtanding the reſiſtance of any Head-piece or Corſlet.</p>

Obſerve by the way, that Targets reſiſted the violence of Arrows. Some write, that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> caus'd them to levy <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens to be Archers, both on Foot and Horſe-back; perhaps he had been taught to do ſo by the loſſes his Competitor <hi>Anthony,</hi> and before him <hi>Craſſus,</hi> ſuffer'd by the <hi>Parthian</hi> Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The wicked Emperour <hi>Domitian</hi> was ſaid to be ſo cunning an Archer, that <hi>Suetonius</hi> writes, he could direct his Arrows to the mark between the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of a Boy, ſtretched one from the other, without hitting any of them; of ſuch we have heard in later times.</p>
                  <p>After the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers were levied and arm'd, they were marked in the Hand, or ſome other place of the Body, and an Oath of Fidelity taken of them, which <hi>Vegetius</hi> in the fifth Chapter of his Second Book deſcribes to be this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it was impos'd by the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great: <hi>I Swear by</hi>

                        <hi>Roman</hi> Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Oath.</note> 
                     <hi>God, by Chriſt, and by the Holy Spirit, and by the Majeſty of the Emperour, whom I worſhip, that I will do all things that he commands me, and that I ſhall never deſert his ſervice, nor refuſe to dye for the</hi> Roman <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> Let us obſerve ſome things of this Oath: Firſt, That in theſe times, Chriſtian Souldiers thought it no ſin to pay Civil Worſhip to their lawful Prince. Secondly, They took more liberty than they ſhould have done, to ſwear by the Emperour; for this being an Oath taken with mature deliberation, and in Judgement, was a greater ſin in them than it was in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to ſwear raſhly (by a bad cuſtome he had learnt among the <hi>Egyptians</hi>) by the Life of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Thirdly, Our Author hath forgot to tell us, what manner of Oath the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers ſwore before the Emperours were converted to the Faith, or what Military Oath was made
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97406:35"/> to the State before the Heathen Emperours uſurped it; though this ſhould have been told us, who deſire to know the Military conſtitutions of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Romans.</hi> I ſuppoſe, they ſwore by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and all the reſt of their Gods, to be faithful to the Senate, and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be obedient to their Commanders, and not to deſert their Standards or Enſigns. This or the like Oath was exacted by the ſeveral Tribunes of every man under their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. But I muſt inform my Reader that this publick and judiciary Swearing Fidelity was not practis'd by the <hi>Romans</hi> till the Second Punick<note place="margin">When firſt impos'd.</note> War. For <hi>Livy</hi> witneſſeth in his 22 Book that before that time no Oath was required of the publick Officers either of State or Militia, only the Foot Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in every Century, and the Horſe-men in every Decurio, were accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to promiſe and ſwear one to another, not to fly one from another, or to deſert the ſervice. But after <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Invaſion, a formal and ſolemn<note place="margin">Its riſe.</note> Oath was impos'd, which, I believe, had its firſt riſe from the Oath which <hi>Publius Cornelius Scipio</hi> at that ſame time both ſwore himſelf, and forc'd other young Gentlemen (who, after the rout of <hi>Cannae,</hi> were preparing to leave <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>) to Swear in theſe words: <hi>I Swear with all my Heart, that I ſhall not deſert the Republick, nor ſuffer any other</hi> Roman <hi>to deſert it: If willingly I fail in this, then may the Greateſt and Beſt</hi> Jupiter <hi>inflict on Me, my Houſe, Family, and Goods, the worſt of evils.</hi> This Swearing and Marking were called the Military Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">Sacrament.</note> after which the Souldiers were enroll'd, and enter'd in pay; neither was it lawful for a <hi>Roman</hi> to fight with an Enemy till he had taken the Oath, and if he kill'd an Enemy before he ſwore Fidelity, he was to be puniſh'd as a Man-ſlayer. The word Sacrament, was by the Fathers in the Primitive times borrowed from the Militia, to ſignifie the Initiation, and Holy Myſteries of the Militant Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Polybius</hi> tells us likewiſe, that the Souldiers at the time of their enrolling, ſwore to obey all the Commands of the Conſul, and of all Officers under him. He ſays likewiſe, that when they came to be encamped, another Oath was<note place="margin">Another Oath.</note> exacted, not only from the Souldiers, but all that followed or belong'd to the Camp, whether Bond or Free, Maſter or Servant, not to ſteal any thing out of the Leaguer, and that, if they found any thing by chance, they ſhould bring it to one of the Tribunes.</p>
                  <p>Other Oaths were likewiſe ſworn, ſometimes voluntarily by the Souldiers<note place="margin">Raſh Oaths.</note> with mutual conſent, ſometimes impos'd by ſome of the Commanders, moſt whereof were raſh or vain; particularly one, That they ſhould not return from Battel without Victory, as <hi>Livy</hi> in his Second Book informs us. And <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his Seventh Book of the <hi>Gallick</hi> War, ſays, that the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men deſir'd that it might be declar'd by a ſolemn Oath, that no man ſhould return either to his Parents, Wife, or Children, who did not charge twice through the Enemy; which being agreed on, all were forc'd to ſwear. And in his Third Book of the Civil War, he tells us, how <hi>Labienus</hi> ſwore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to deſert <hi>Pompey,</hi> but to ſhare with him in all his Fortunes; the like did<note place="margin">An Oath ill kept.</note> the reſt of his Army.

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of Sieges, and Defence of Towns and Forts, and of the great Engines and Machines uſed in them, by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and other Ancients.</head>
                  <p>THE ſeveral ways by which Towns, Caſtles, and Forts, in our Modern.<note place="margin">The Ancients expugned Towns as we do.</note> Art of War, (as they are deſcribed in the twenty fourth Chapter of my Diſcourſes of the Modern Militia) are taken, were all uſed by the Ancients; for Gun-powder hath only augmented the violence and fury of the Battery, and furniſh'd us with more fearful and mortal Darts, than the men of old were acquainted with. In ancient times, Towns were taken by Circumvalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſtarving the Defendants out of them, they were taken by formal Sieges and approaches, they were taken by Aſſault, by Scalado, by Surprizal, and by Treachery; and they are ſtill taken by ſome of theſe. If they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the place, either for its Scituation, Fortification, or Defendants, ſo inconſiderable, that it did not deſerve a formal Siege, or that they either could not, or would not ſpend time upon it, they ſtorm'd it very ſoon after they came to it, with Ladders or Grapples, or with a Tortoiſe or Pent-houſe made of their Shields, whereof I ſpoke in the foregoing Chapter. And in doing this, they environed it with a <hi>Corona,</hi> as they called it, or a Crown;<note place="margin">Corona.</note> which is, they drew up their Armies round about the Town, in manner of a Crown, leaving no part free from being inveſted. But <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Interpreters tell him, that when their Anceſtors were to aſſault a Town, they left a part of it free unenviron'd, <hi>non cingebant Coronâ,</hi> that whoever came out at that place and ſubmitted, ſhould be pardon'd. I think this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome had prudence in it as well as pity, and verified the ſaying, <hi>A Golden Bridge for a Flying Enemy.</hi> This <hi>Corona,</hi> or Crown, was ſometimes a ſingle Crown, ſometimes a Double, and very often a Triple one, according to the quality or greatneſs of the place, or the number of thoſe that were to attack it. If it were a Three-fold Crown, the firſt was compos'd of the heavy armed foot,<note place="margin">The firſt Crown.</note> who were to give the aſſault, and in it to defend themſelves with their Targets, and other Defenſive Arms: Behind them was the Second Crown,<note place="margin">Second.</note> of the <hi>Velites</hi> or light armed, whoſe buſineſs was, with Darts, Stones, and Arrows, to beat away the Defendants from the Parapets, that the heavy arm'd might ſtorm with the leſs oppoſition. Behind theſe <hi>Velites,</hi> was the Third Crown, which conſiſted of the Cavalry; and theſe ſtood for two uſes,<note place="margin">Third.</note> firſt, to hinder the Foot from flying, (a thing practis'd ſometimes in the Modern Wars) ſecondly, to prevent any danger that might ariſe by the ſudden arrival of an unexpected Enemy. If it was not thought fit to try this ſudden way of Expugnation, or that it had been try'd without ſucceſs, then approaches were made with the help of thoſe Engines, which have been time out of mind laid aſide, as altogether uſeleſs in our Modern Expugnation of Forts.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Machines were of two kinds, Leſſer and Greater. The Leſſer were<note place="margin">Leſſer En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines.</note> the Moſcles and all manner of Mantilets, which were indeed no other but Pent-houſes and Shrowds, and under that name you may comprehend the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea, Plutei, Crates,</hi> and ſuch like; under the ſhelter whereof the Ancient ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached to ſtrong holds. The Greater Engines were the Tortoiſe, the<note place="margin">The greater ones.</note> Ram, the Scorpion, the Onagra, the Baliſt, and the Catapult; for moſt of which, men have not yet found out proper words in the Modern Languages. Then there was that great Engine which excell'd them all for efficacy, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of admiration, both to Antiquity it ſelf, and to us too, who have ſeen and heard the Thundring Canon; and that was, the Moving or Ambulatory Tower.</p>

                        <hi>Teſtudo</hi> or Tortoiſe.</note> Chapter, there was an artificial Engine, which the Ancients cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Teſtudo</hi> or Tortoiſe. This was made of ſuch a bigneſs as it pleas'd the General of the Army, or General of the Artillery to appoint; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was a great Beam, which ſometimes had on the end of it an Iron Hook or Grapple, which they ſhut forth when they thought fit to draw Stones out of a Wall, or for other uſes, and pull'd the Beam in again, when they pleas'd; and therefore they gave it the name of that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which can put it ſelf out of its ſhell, and in again when it, pleaſeth. And ſometimes on the end of this Beam, ſaith <hi>Vegetius,</hi> was faſten'd a great Iron Head for Battery, and was called a Ram, either becauſe the bulk of Iron was faſhion'd in the form of a Rams Head, or becauſe after every ſtroak, it was forcibly drawn back, that at its return it might batter more violently, as the cuſtome of Rams is, when they fight. This is all <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Teſtudo</hi> or <hi>Aries,</hi> except that he makes the laſt to be put in the loweſt Stage of the Ambulatory Tower.</p>
                  <p>But other Authors tell us, that the <hi>Aries,</hi> or Ram was of it ſelf a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Machine. And as the manner of our War is now, to give the worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to the beſieged, when they hold out the Battery of Ordnance; ſo of old, thoſe who did not yield before the Ram had touch'd the Wall, got the worſe quarters. <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his Seventh Book of the <hi>French</hi> War, ſays, he gave ſome of the <hi>Gauls</hi> their lives, becauſe they render'd themſelves before the Ram began to batter.</p>
                  <p>The deſcription of this Engine, is thus given us by <hi>Achilles Terduzzi:</hi> A great Beam and of a great length, 200 foot and more, made like the Maſt of a Ship,<note place="margin">

This Beam was ſupported by two other great ones, which made the baſe of the Engine, they meeting above in a ſharp Angle, kept the Ram ſuſpended in an <hi>Aequilibrie.</hi> It was manag'd by Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers behind, and as many on both ſides as could be conveniently lodged, in Tortoiſes, Moſcles, or other Pent-houſes, that were ordain'd to convey it.

And yet we have ſeen Stone Walls of Towns, built by the Ancients, make a notable reſiſtance againſt the Battery of Whole Cannon. It ſoon made ſuch a breach in the Wall, that Miners could lodge in it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it as they pleas'd. In the time of its Battery, it was defended above with Hurdles, Baskets full of Earth, and Raw Hides, and on both ſides with Moſcles, Vines, and Tortoiſes, out of, or from under which the beſiegers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly caſt their miſſiles againſt the Defendants. And they, at the approach of the Ram to the Wall, beat it with huge great Stones, or heavy lumps and<note place="margin">How it was oppos'd.</note> weights of Lead, tyed with ſtrong Ropes or Chains of Iron to a Crane or Telenon: Thoſe who were appointed to defend the Ram, endeavour'd to gripe thoſe Ropes or Chains with long Hooks or Grapples; and on the other ſide the beſieged eſſayed with long Scythes to cut the Cords, which govern'd and ſuſtain'd the Ram. The Defendants alſo uſed to hang over the Walls, Beds, and great ſacks fill'd with Straw, Feathers, or Wooll, which broke the ſorce of the ſtroaks before they came to the Wall; and theſe are all of good uſe in any Retrenchment ſuddenly made up againſt the Battery of Canon, in our time.

In ſuch a diverſity of opinions, I think, <hi>Achilles Terduzzi</hi> offers a fair expedient of agreement, which is, that it is<note place="margin">An expedient of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> probable, in the times of the Emperours the names of Catapult and Baliſt were confounded, ſo that the one was taken for the other; or that by a new Invention, not heard of before, both the one and the other threw both Darts and Stones.</p>
                  <p>The Baliſt and the Catapult were made and fram'd according to the weight of the Stone, and the length of the Dart or other miſſiles which they were ordain'd to ſhoot; as our Ordnance are founded according to the weight of the Bullet intended for them; from whence many of them have their deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, as a three, four, or ſix pounder.

                  <p>There were, if you will believe Authors, ſome of theſe Machines, which could ſhoot Stones of one hundred, ſome two hundred, and ſome of them three hundred and ſixty pound; and thoſe that caſt one hundred pound, threw their Stones the length of two <hi>Stadia,</hi> or Furlongs, and theſe make the fourth part of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile.

                  <p>And now I come to ſpeak of the Moving or Ambulatory Tower, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<note place="margin">Ambulatory Tower.</note> that which <hi>Vegetius</hi> writes is enough to aſtoniſh any Reader, who hath not heard of it before, but he who will read other Writers, will eaſily believe all <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſays on that ſubject: He tells us, they were built after the form of Houſes, thirty, forty, or fifty foot broad, and ſo high as to equal the height of Towers on the Wall. The Tower which our Author deſcribes, is three ſtories high: In the loweſt he lodgeth a Ram, with men to manage it, and that, when the Tower came within convenient diſtance, batter'd the Wall. In the third and higheſt ſtage he placed the <hi>Velites,</hi> who afflicted the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants with Darts and Arrows, and pelted them with Stones out of their Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Slings, to neceſſitate them to quit the defence of the Parapets: And in the middle Story he placeth a Bridge, one end whereof being laid upon the Wall, and the other remaining fix'd within the Tower, Bands of armed men paſs'd ſafely over, and then, ſaith our Author, <hi>Illi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is the Moving Tower, which is called <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris Vegetiana.</hi> If this Tower of his be wonderful enough, what ſhall we ſay of thoſe Towers which were one hundred and twenty Cubits high, that is, one hundred and eighty foot, and ſixty or ſeventy foot broad, in which might<note place="margin">Towers twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtories high.</note> be eighteen or twenty ſeveral ſtages or ſtories, and every one of theſe capable to contain Baliſts and Catapults, and men to manage them, beſides arm'd Souldiers to handle their Weapons. Or what ſhall we think of that Tower whereof <hi>Livy</hi> ſpeaks in his thirty ſecond Book, which one of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Conſuls made of ſeveral ſtories, out of which (you muſt ſuppoſe by Bridges) he ſent whole Cohorts of Legionaries, one to ſuſtain and relieve another, againſt a <hi>Macedonian</hi> Phalange, that ſtood in Battel ready to receive them within the Walls; and we are to believe, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Cohorts at that time were about five hundred ſtrong, and yet the <hi>Macedonians</hi> made the place good againſt them all. The ſame Author tells us of another Tower,<note place="margin">A ſtupendious Tower.</note> which <hi>Hannibal</hi> made at <hi>Saguntum,</hi> in which he had numbers of armed men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his great Machines. <hi>Steuechius</hi> tells us, that <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> Maſter of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines, or General of the Artillery, writes of a Moving Tower, which weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three hundred and ſixty thouſand pounds, not reckoning the Men, Arms, and Engines that were within it: And that it could reſiſt the force of Stones ſhot out of Baliſts of three hundred and fifty pound. But that which is more admirable than all I have yet ſaid, is, what the ſame <hi>Vitruvius</hi> writes of an Engineer, who made a Counter-machine within a Beſieged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Town, by which<note place="margin">An Incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Engine.</note> he drew one of the Beſiegers Ambulatory Towers, within the Walls of the beleaguer'd Town. Let me ſay here with <hi>Ovid, Si ſit credenda vetuſtas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Moving Towers were compoſed of great Beams, Joyſts, Raſters, and Boards, cover'd with Raw Hides, and ſome of them were fac'd with Iron. They mov'd on many Wheels, which were puſh'd forward below with<note place="margin">How the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er mov'd.</note> the ſtrength of many men, aſſiſted with Leavers; the Tower was open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, that it might more conveniently be thruſt forward by thoſe numbers of men ordain'd for that purpoſe. Before it went many Mantlets, Vines, and Moſcles, full of armed Souldiers, who were both to make way for it, and to defend it from thoſe, who might ſally out to burn or deſtroy it. It was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times drawn by Beaſts of Carriage, but theſe had Machines before and about them, to defend them from the Darts and Arrows of the Beſieged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This laſt part being neglected by <hi>

                     </hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> when he beſieged <hi>Rome,</hi> the famous <hi>Belliſarius,</hi> who was within the City, ſuffer'd the Tower to come pretty near the Walls, and then cauſed to be killed the Beaſts with Darts and Arrows; this made the Tower ſtand ſtill, and ſo render'd all its preparations (which were very coſtly) ineffectual, and the Fabrick it ſelf contemptible and ridiculous to the Beſieged.</p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:97406:38"/>
                  <p>Several means were uſed to fruſtrate the effects of this dreadful Machine;<note place="margin">How it was oppoſed.</note> theſe were, Firſt, A Deſperate Sally, by which the Beſiegers guards being beaten from the Tower, it ſelf became a prey, and was eaſily burnt. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, They uſed to undermine the ground, which the Tower was to traverſe (and that was ſoon ſeen and perceiv'd) before it approach'd the Walls, and that indeed was a ſure way, for the vaſt weight of it, not having ground to ſupport it, would quickly make it ſink, and ſtick faſt. Thirdly, They uſed to make ſuch a Tower within the Walls, and oppoſe it to that without. This was, no doubt, a good help, but a very coſtly one. And Laſtly, They endeavoured to burn them with Wild Fire, or Fiery Arrows.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes theſe Ambulatory Towers were made with that Artifice, that when one of them approach'd the Wall, whoſe height the Tower ſeem'd not<note place="margin">Turricul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I told you in the fourth Chapter of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Militia, that <hi>Demetrius</hi> could not be the firſt Inventer of the Moving Tower, (though it be very<note place="margin">The Moving Tower of an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ancient pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctice.</note> probable, he hath added much to it) for his Fathers Maſter made uſe of one of them at <hi>Gaza,</hi> and <hi>Curti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

One of theſe Towers which <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> erected againſt a Town of the <hi>Nervians,</hi> (if I miſtake not) wrought a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect, for the Defendants laugh'd and flouted at it, as a thing made to no purpoſe, ſince it could not hurt them at ſuch a diſtance, till they ſaw it begin to move towards their Walls, and then they began to have other thoughts.</p>
                  <p>All theſe Machines were ordinarily made in the place where they were to be uſed, but if the Generals conceiv'd that at the Towns they intended to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege, they could not be accommodated with things requiſite for theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks, then they carried all the materials along with them, on Camels, Mules, Horſes, Carts, and Waggons; As the Great <hi>Turk</hi> carrieth his Metal with him, till he come where he intendeth to make uſe of Ordnance, and there he cauſeth them to be founded.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all theſe ways ſpoken of for expugnation of Towns, the Ancients made frequent uſe of Mines; this the <hi>Romans</hi> call'd <hi>Cuniculos agere,</hi> becauſe Mines reſemble the digging of Rabbets; neither did the Beſieged in thoſe<note place="margin">Mines.</note> times want the knowledge to find out Mines, and provide Counter-mines againſt them. The way of Mining they uſed, and we ſtill do, is all one, except that they wanted the ſpringing of Mines by Gun-powder, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the uſe they made of Mines produced a two-fold effect. Firſt, The Mine<note place="margin">Firſt effect of the Ancients Mine.</note> being brought within the Town, without taking notice of the Walls, Souldiers ſuddenly iſſued out, and run to the Ports to open them, and ſo make way for the Beſiegers to enter, and at that time ordinarily Alarms were given to all quarters, that the Beſiegers might be diverted, and not ſuffer'd to obſerve the Sally of thoſe who were enter'd the Town by the Mine: Such a Mine, and the effect of it, <hi>Hannibal</hi> had at <hi>Saguntum.</hi> Secondly, When they had made large<note place="margin">Second effect.</note> Chambers in the Walls, they under-propt them with logs of dry Timber, and having laid ſtore of combuſtible matter beſide them, ſo ſoon as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was ready to ſtorm, Fire was put to the Train, and the ſupporters being burnt, the Wall immediately fell, over the ruines whereof the Beſiegers enter'd. And this effect had the Great <hi>Alexanders</hi> Mine at <hi>Gaza. Aeneas</hi> tells us of a<note place="margin">Mines how diſcovered.</note> Shield of Braſs uſed in his time to diſcover Mines, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ſame <hi>Aeneas,</hi> an old <hi>Grecian</hi> Tactick, adviſeth againſt all manner of<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aeneas</hi> his Sails.</note> the Ancient approaches to Beſieged places, to hang up great Sails within the Walls, which he will have to ſerve for three uſes. Firſt, For Blinds, that what is done within, may not be ſeen by thoſe without, a thing ordinarily
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:97406:39"/> practis'd in our Modern Wars. Secondly, That all the Darts and Arrows that are caſt or ſhot, even from the Moving Towers, may be receiv'd in theſe Sails, where ſticking all the day long, they can do no hurt, and at night may be taken out, and thrown or ſhot back to the Enemy. This would be uſeleſs againſt our Bullets. Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They were notable Defences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Fiery Arrows, ſhot ordinarily to fire Houſes thatch'd with Straw or Reeds.</p>
                  <p>But indeed, there is no ſuch ſolid or ſure defence againſt all manner of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and Mines, againſt all Machines and Engines of the Ancients, and Batteries of Modern Artillery, as that which the ſame Author <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſpeaks of, and that is, a Double Wall, and a Double Ditch. For the firſt, being long, and well defended, the ſecond impoſeth a neceſſity on the Beſiegers to begin new Approaches, new Batteries, and new Mines. But if the place be<note place="margin">Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mures or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments.</note> not doubly fortified, then he adviſeth the Beſieged to make a Counter-mure within that part of the Wall, againſt which the Aſſailants make their Battery. The ſame is done ſtill, or ſhould be done in all beſieged places. It is that we call a Retrenchment, and the <hi>Germans</hi> an <hi>Abſuerd.</hi> It was by this the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeans</hi> kept out the long Siege of their Town againſt the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> till hunger made them yield to their mercileſs Enemy: And hereby did the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> fruſtrate all the means the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul uſed for the expugnation of their City, with Catapults, Rams, and Moving Towers, till Famine forc'd them to ſubmit to his cruel pleaſure. Concerning Mines, Countermures, or Retrenchments, you may ſee a little more in the twenty fourth Diſcourſe of the Modern Art of War.</p>

That which <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Roman</hi> Exerciſes in all thoſe Chapters, is briefly this: That the <hi>Latine</hi> word <hi>Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rcitus,</hi> an Army, is deriv'd <hi>ab exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendo,</hi> from Exerciſing: That the <hi>Tyrones,</hi> or raw Souldiers were Train'd in the <hi>Campus Martius, Mars</hi> his Field, which lay near the <hi>Tiber,</hi> in which (when they were weary of their Land exerciſes) they waſh'd themſelves, and learn'd to Swim, a thing very incumbent for a Souldier to practiſe, becauſe, ſaith<note place="margin">Swimming.</note> he, Armies have not always the conveniency of Bridges, and muſt, in that caſe, when they either follow or retire from an Enemy, ſwim Rivers. Before <hi>Vegetius</hi> go further, I muſt remember him of two things: Firſt, that <hi>Campus Martius</hi> got but that name after the <hi>Tarq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>nes</hi> were baniſh'd out of <hi>Rome,</hi> for it belong'd to them in propriety; and at the time of their leaving the City was a Corn-field, as <hi>Livy</hi> tells us. Now certainly the <hi>Romans</hi> had their Military Exerciſes the whole time of the Reigns of their ſeven Kings. Secondly, I ſay, as Swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming is fit to be learned by all young men, eſpecially Souldiers; ſo I think an Army is in a deſperate condition, when the men who compoſe it, are put to ſwim for their ſafety from a purſuing Enemy, for by that ſhift, hardly will the tenth man eſcape; nor needs a retiring Army fear much hurt from an Enemy who cannot overtake it but by Swimming over Lakes and Rivers. But our Author proceeds, and tells us, that an Army muſt be taught to march in Rank and File, that an Enemy may take no advantage by finding it in diſorder. The <hi>Romans</hi> had two kinds of a March, the Ambulatory,<note place="margin">Two kinds of March.</note> and the Curſory. By the firſt, they were (if ſo required) to march twenty <hi>Italian</hi> miles in five hours, and by the ſecond, twenty five in four hours, with their full Arms, Baggage, and Burthens. Thirdly, He informs us, that the Foot Souldier was Train'd at a Stake or Palliſado of Wood, ſix foot long,<note place="margin">Exerciſes of the Foot.</note> fixed faſt in the ground; he had a Target of O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Fourthly, The Foot were taught at theſe Exerciſes to carry burthens of ſixty pound, that being habituated, they might thereafter more eaſily carry their own Arms, Proviſions, Baggage, or what elſe they were commanded to bear. Fifthly, The Horſe men were taught to mount Wooden Horſes in the Fields, if it<note place="margin">Of the Horſe.</note> was Summer; but in Winter, in Houſes made purpoſely for that uſe, and thereafter to mount living Horſes, at firſt, without Arms, but after they were expert, they were to get on Horſe back with full Arms, either at the Right or Left ſide of the Horſe, and as you will find hereafter, without Stirrups; and with drawn Swords or Maces in their hands. Thrice a month, ſaith <hi>Vegetius,</hi> by the conſtitutions of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Adrian,</hi> the <hi>Veteran</hi> Armies were to be Exerciſed, and to march ten miles out of their Camp, and back again that day. And he ſaith, that Souldiers were taught to run, leap Ditches, and to make Ditches and Ramparts. This is the ſubſtance of all that <hi>Veg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tius</hi> delivers to us in thoſe mention'd eleven Chapters of his Firſt Book. Now in the twenty third Chapter of his Second Book, he troubles himſelf and his Reader with the repetition of moſt of this, only he adds, that the young Souldiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or <hi>Tyrones,</hi> were Exerciſed twice a day, morning and evening, the <hi>Veterans</hi> once a day; and this was done without intermiſſion. So it ſeems what he ſpeaks here, is meant of Training particular Souldiers or Companies once or twice a day, and what he ſaid before, was of Exerciſing the whole Army once a month. Thus far, and no further, we have the help of <hi>Vegetius</hi> in the matter of Training, drilling, or Exerciſing.</p>
                  <p>Before I inform you further of the ſeveral kinds of the <hi>Roman</hi> Exerciſes, I<note place="margin">Burthens.</note> muſt ſee what Burthens the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers were obliged to carry in their Marches, whether thoſe were Ambulatory, or Curſory. And firſt, I believe, that the weight of ſixty pound, which <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſaith they were bound to carry, was meant only of their Arms, Defenſive and Offenſive. And I ſuppoſe, you may be of my opinion, if you conſider their heavy Head, Back, and Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces, their Greeves, Taſlets, Target, and an Iron Boot, a Javeline or two, and a Sword, and it may be, a Dagger too. And if theſe weighed ſixty pound, what ſhall we ſay of their Fardles, their Proviſions, the Stakes and Palliſadoes they were bound to carry, and of ſome utenſils to make ready their meat? and theſe perhaps were carried alternatively by thoſe that belong'd to one <hi>Contubernium;</hi> for if I conjecture right, Beaſts of Carriage were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowed for carrying their Tents and Hand-mills. <hi>Quinti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Being perfectly wearied of thoſe terrible Burthens, I return to the exerciſes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, and theſe I find divided into three kinds. The firſt is, of thoſe who were peculiarly and properly called Military Exerciſes; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, of thoſe duties the Souldiers owed to their Superiour Officers; and the third, of their work and fatigue.</p>
                  <p>The Exerciſes properly called Military, were of ſeven ſorts. Firſt, To march<note place="margin">Firſt kind of Military Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes.</note> or run in full Arms twenty, or twenty five miles in four or five hours time. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, To leap over Ditches. Thirdly, To ſwim Rivers, at which <hi>Julius C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſar</hi> was excellent. Fourthly, to skirmiſh or fight with Sword and with Target, heavier than ordinary ones. Fifthly, To lance and throw Darts and Javelines. Sixthly, To throw Stones at a mark, either with the Hand, Sling, or Batton-Sling. Seventhly, To mount or diſmount a Horſe on any ſide, in full Arms, with Swords or Maces in their hands, and without a Stirrup: The laſt <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getius</hi> forgot, yet of all theſe ſorts he hath made mention.</p>
                  <p>The Second kind of Exerciſes was of thoſe Duties and Services the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers<note place="margin">Second kind.</note> owed and payed to their Officers and Commanders, beſide the publick du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they owed to the State. Theſe were to ſet up their Tents and Pavillions, to make convenient places for their Servants, Neceſſaries and Baggage, and ſometimes to empale them round about, to keep all places about their Lodgings and the Streets likewiſe clean from mire, dirt, or duſt, and (if they were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp for any time) to lay the ground with Sand, and much more of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Theſe ſervices all Souldiers were bound to perform, except ſuch, who for ſome reaſons, were exempted and freed from all publick duties, and were only bound to fight, and wait on the Conſuls. Thoſe who had no exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were called <hi>Munifices,</hi> Duty-doers. There are ſome who ſay, that the <hi>Triarii</hi> were free from theſe duties, and particular ſervices to Officers; and full well it might be ſo, ſince they were bound to look to the Horſes of the Cavalry, and therefore in Encamping were conſtantly quarter'd beſide them, as you will ſee in my diſcourſe of their Caſtrametation. But from other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick works they were not free, for they fortified the Camp; which both <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> and <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>The third kind of a <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers Exerciſe was work and labour, which<note place="margin">Third kind.</note> in our Modern Armies is not ſo unuſual, as <hi>Lipſius</hi> would make it, as ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated againſt him in its proper place. Indeed, there were not ſuch creatures as Pioneers known in the old <hi>Roman</hi> Armies, all was wrought by the Souldiers
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97406:41"/> themſelves; yea, ſome write, that their <hi>Velites</hi> were not admitted to work, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be imployed in a ſervice of ſo much reputation, and ſo it ſeems, it was a Maxime with them diametrically contrary to ours, which was, The greater Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, the greater Honour. Of theſe publick works there were many kinds, theſe were, the Cutting, Carrying and Squaring Turf and Sods, Stakes and Palliſadoes for their Camps, Caſtles, Towns, Forts, and Sconces, the fortifying all of theſe, working and digging at the Approaches, and expugnation of Forts and Towns, the making and managing great Engines, Mining, Countermining, making Retrenchments or Countermures, cutting deep Ditches and Channels of a very great length, building Magazines, Amphitheatres, and other huge and vaſt Edifices, and all theſe with many more, not only in time of War, but of the calmeſt Peace, when no neceſſity could be pretended for them, and thoſe not ſo much for the ornament of Countries and Provinces, (though that was likewiſe taken into conſideration) as to inure the Souldiers to toil, and to keep them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated to it, that when they were neceſſitated to fatigue in earneſt, they might find it eaſie, as that which was no new thing to them; and they found that this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour procur'd to the Souldiery both health and ſtrength. <hi>Suetonius</hi> ſays, that <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> before he was Emperour, <hi>Veteranum &amp; Tyronem militem aſſiduo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Numantia,</hi> where he frequently told his Souldiers, That he who would bathe his hands in the blood of his Enemies, muſt firſt ſoil them with dirt and mire. It muſt be obſerv'd, that the <hi>Romans</hi> fortified their Camps with their Swords at their ſides, as we read in Sacred Hiſtory <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did, and made the <hi>Jews</hi> do, when they re-built the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> We read, that <hi>Corbulo,</hi> a great Captain, and Reformer of decay'd diſcipline, put two of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers<note place="margin">Severe Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</note> to death, becauſe he found them working at a Rampart, the one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Sword or Dagger, the other with a Dagger, but without a Sword. The ſame <hi>Corbulo</hi> being commanded by his Tyrannical Maſter <hi>Nero,</hi> to make Peace with the <hi>Germans,</hi> leſt his Army ſhould languiſh with idleneſs, caus'd them to cut a Ditch three and twenty <hi>Italian</hi> miles long, between the Rivers of the <hi>Maes</hi> and the <hi>Rhine;</hi> for it was a rule with them, That labour hardens and corroborates, whereas idleneſs weakens and effeminates; the truth whereof is taught us by experience.</p>
                  <p>But truly, who will rightly conſider the ſtupendous works of the <hi>Romans,</hi> made by a few men, and in a ſhort time, may (as one obſerveth) ſay, they were thoſe Gyants, who, as the Poets feign, caſt one Mountain on another, ſo to climb up to Heaven. For not to ſpeak of their building Temples, Theatres, Caſtles, Towers and Baths, their draining Mariſhes, cutting out Channels, Cauſeying ways, and Paving ſtreets, all which are the works of Peace, Who can read without admiration, of their Works and Fortifications in the time of War, as particularly either <hi>Caeſars</hi> Circumvallations at <hi>Aleſia,</hi>

But methinks the <hi>Nervians</hi> far ſurpaſs'd them all, who (as you have it in <hi>Caeſars</hi> Fifth Book of the <hi>French</hi> War) having learned ſomething of Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from ſome Priſoners or Fugitive <hi>Romans,</hi> beſieg'd <hi>Cicero,</hi> one of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> Legates, in his Winter quarter, where they made a Circumvallation of fifteen miles circumference, the Rampart eleven foot high, and the Ditch fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen foot broad or deep, without the help of any Tools, except their Swords, (wherewith they cut the Turf and Sods) and their Head-pieces and Hands, wherewith they caſt up the Earth, and all this in the ſpace of three hours. An action ſo far beyond humane ſtrength, that it would far ſurpaſs all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of belief, if it were not warranted by the down-right relation and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſo renown'd an Author, and an eye-witneſs.</p>

                  <p>HOW the Ancient and Illuſtrious <hi>Romans</hi> divided their Foot into heavy and light, and how both were Arm'd, I have ſufficiently inform'd you.

                        <hi>Velites</hi> mixed with Horſe.</note> the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe, till one <hi>Navius,</hi> a Centurion, made a propoſition, that in ſuch Rencounters the Horſe-men ſhould take Darters on the croups of their Horſes, which was done. Now when the Beſieged Sallied, and came up to the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe, the <hi>Velites</hi> alighted, and run before the Horſe-men, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Darts, (whereof they were order'd to have ſeven) at the Enemy, and then retir'd to their own Horſe, having done (as may be ſuppoſed) ſo much miſchief to the <hi>Hannibalians,</hi> and brought them into ſuch diſorder, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe often had a cheap Market of them. <hi>Navius</hi> might well have been the firſt <hi>Roman</hi> that thought of this way of fight of Horſe and Foot mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, but it was practis'd long before his time by the Great <hi>Alexander,</hi> and others.

But the reaſon <hi>Lipſius</hi> gives for his opinion will not prove the thing; it is this: <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſometimes interlin'd his Cavalry with <hi>Anteſignani,</hi> now theſe were heavy arm'd, therefore he had no <hi>Velites;</hi> but this will not follow; for why might not the heavy armed Foot fight among the Horſe, as well as the Horſe many times were brought to fight among the heavy arm'd Foot, for that depended on the Conſuls pleaſure, to bring ſome Foot from the Battel to the Wings, or ſome Horſe from the Wings to the Battel, a thing fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently practis'd.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Velites</hi> had their denomination a <hi>Velocitate,</hi> from Swiftneſs. In time of Service or Battel, they were ſometimes imployed in the Rear, ſometimes<note place="margin">

Some apprehend, that in their Retreat they divided themſelves into three Bodies, the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> the ſecond behind the <hi>Principes,</hi> and the third behind the <hi>Triarii.</hi> But aſſuredly they are miſtaken, for after the <hi>Velites</hi> had quitted the field, the heavy arm'd began the Combate, firſt the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> and they being worſted, retir'd to the <hi>Principes,</hi> but this they could not do feaſibly, if a Body of <hi>Velites</hi> ſtood between them and the <hi>Principes,</hi> nor could the <hi>Principes</hi> retire to the <hi>Triarii,</hi> if another Body of <hi>Velites</hi> ſtood between them: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think I have reaſon to conclude, that when the <hi>Velites</hi> were beaten out of the field, they retir'd ſtraight to the Rear of the <hi>Triarii,</hi> through the direct intervals of all the three Claſſes of the heavy armed, and there attended the Conſuls further pleaſure. Yet if you look on any Figure of a Legion, you ſhall ordinarily ſee the <hi>Velites</hi> drawn up in three diſtinct Bodies, behind the three ſeveral Batallions of the Legionaries, which might have been done when they were marſhall'd, before the Fight began; but for the reaſon I have ſpoke of, could not be after they had fought, and retir'd.

                  <p>The Body of the heavy armed Infantry was compos'd of three ſeveral Claſſes, thoſe were, the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> the <hi>Principes,</hi> and the <hi>Triarii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt Claſs was of the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> who were, as I told you before, the<note place="margin">Haſtati.</note> youngeſt in the election, and for moſt part <hi>Novitiates.</hi> I find no difference of their Arms from thoſe of the <hi>Principes,</hi> and what thoſe were, I have told you in the third Chapter, to which henceforward I conſtantly remit you, as to the matter of Arms. But I conceive they had their name of <hi>Haſtati, ab Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtâ,</hi> that is, a Spear, which probably they have carried in the Reigns of ſome of their Kings; and though afterward they came to change their Weapon, yet they ſtill retain'd their name. Theſe <hi>Haſtati</hi> made the firſt Batallion, whatever <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſay to the contrary, as ſhall be ſufficiently demonſtrated, when I come to examine his Legion. The ſecond Claſs was of the <hi>Principes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Principes.</note> who were the ſtrongeſt and luſtieſt men, and had moſt of them ſerv'd former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and were in the ſtrength of their age, and had their denomination, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, becauſe they were the principal men for ſtrength and vigour; theſe made the ſecond Batallion of the Legion. The third Claſs was of the <hi>Triarii: Lipſius</hi> thinks they were called ſo, <hi>quaſi Tertiarii,</hi> becauſe they made the third<note place="margin">Triarii.</note> Batallion. I think the Etymology is far fought, but it is fit I admit it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I cannot give a better. Yet it is certain that their more ancient name
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97406:42"/> was <hi>Pilani,</hi> and their whole Body or Squadron was called <hi>Pilus,</hi> no doubt,<note place="margin">Called <hi>Pilan;</hi>
                     </note> from <hi>Pilum</hi> the Javeline; and if ſo, then it is more than probable, that in older times, neither the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> nor the <hi>Principes</hi> carried Javelines, becauſe both of them in Hiſtory are called <hi>Antepilani.</hi> In <hi>Polybius</hi> his time, the <hi>Triarii</hi> carried no Javeline at all, and yet even then they kept their old name of <hi>Pila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.</hi> All the difference of Arms that I find between them and the other two Claſſes, both before, and in <hi>Polybius</hi>'s time, is, that the <hi>Triarii</hi> carried a ſhort Spear, which they call'd <hi>Haſtile,</hi> of nine foot long, and I have told you in the<note place="margin">Carried ſhort Spears.</note> third Chapter, that the <hi>Pilum</hi> or Javeline, by <hi>Polybius</hi> his own deſcription, was near ſeven foot long. Why theſe ſhort Spears were given them inſtead of Javelines, Authors tell us not. <hi>Lipſius</hi> makes a conjecture, which in my opinion is a very ſorry one. He ſaith, the <hi>Triarii</hi> being plac'd in the Rear of the other two Batallions, their Javelines could have done them no ſervice againſt an Enemy at ſo great a diſtance. What a pitiful Reaſon is this? For the <hi>Triarii</hi> were not bound to fight with either Javeline, ſhort Spear, or any other Weapon, till either the <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Haſtati</hi> retir'd to them, or that they themſelves were brought up to the Van; and in any of theſe two caſes, Javelines would have ſerv'd them to as good purpoſe, as they did the two Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions marſhall'd before them. And if theſe ſhort Spears ſerv'd the <hi>Triarii</hi> better when they came to fight, than the Javelines, then they ſhould likewiſe have ſerv'd the other two Claſſes better than the Javeline, and ſo the <hi>Pilum,</hi> or Javeline, ſhould have been laid aſide as uſeleſs. And therefore, I think, <hi>Lipſius</hi> here hath not hit the mark. To me, it would rather ſeem, that in a<note place="margin">Why they carried not Javelines.</note> medley, when perchance an Enemy vigorouſly purſued the <hi>Principes,</hi> the <hi>Triarii</hi> could not, without wronging their Friends (who were retiring) caſt their Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velines with ſo much advantage, as they could manage theſe ſhort Spears.

                  <p>Theſe <hi>Triarii</hi> were the eldeſt and moſt experimented of the <hi>Roman</hi> Foot, and therefore were kept for the laſt Reſerve, not at all fighting, if the other two Bodies beat the Enemy, but if thoſe were beaten, or order'd to retire, (as ſometimes they were) then they aroſe, and made a freſh and furious on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and if that prevail'd not, the ſafety of the Army depended either on their Flight; or on a fair and orderly Retreat.

In the ſixteenth Chapter of his ſecond Book, he makes them kneel but on one knee, and this, I believe, is the trueſt. But in the fourteenth Chapter of his third Book, to my thinking, he makes them fit, which, I ſuppoſe, could not

                  <p>Each of theſe three Claſſes of the heavy armed Foot was divided into Centuries. Two Centuries made a Maniple, three Maniples made a Cohort, and ten Cohorts made up a Legion.

The Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons badge was a Branch, Rod, or Twig of a Vine, wherewith he had power to beat or whip thoſe of his Centuriate as they deſerv'd. It is not half an age ſince a Corporal uſed to carry a Musket-reſt in his hand, wherewith he might beat thoſe of his Corporalſhip according to their Miſdemeanors.

Every Centuriate had a Banner or Colours, and the Enſign-bearer was choſen by the Centurion; nor can I find, that this Enſign-bearer was any diſtinct Officer, but only ſome one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers, whom for his Courage and Strength the Centurion entruſted with the Enſign; for his Command was none at all, and his profit as little, being no otherwiſe paid than as other Souldiers were, only he was a ſtep nearer preferment than they.</p>
                  <p>Two Centuriates made a Maniple, ſo called from a wiſp or handful of Hay, tyed<note place="margin">
                        <hi>A</hi> Maniple.</note> to a long Pole, which perhaps was the firſt Enſign that ever <hi>Romulus</hi> carried. The Maniple had no particular Commander, the oldeſt Centurion commanded the Right hand Centuriate, and the youngeſt the Left hand one. The Maniple had two Enſigns, one for each Centuriate. And this <hi>Lipſius</hi> (convinc'd by Hiſtory) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth in the firſt Dialogue of his fourth Book of his Commentary on <hi>Polybius,</hi> yet in the third Dialogue of that ſame Book, he ſeems to allow but one Enſign to the Maniple. But he doth worſe, for in the third Dialogue of his ſecond Book (ſpeaking of that paſſage in <hi>Livy</hi>'s eighth Book, where he makes three Enſigns to be in one Maniple, made up of <hi>Triarii, Rorarii,</hi> and <hi>Accenſi) Lipſius</hi> ſaith it might be ſo; for, ſaith he, there may be Colours where there is no Commander, whereof the <hi>Rorarii</hi> and <hi>Accenſi</hi> had none. This is ſtrange Doctrine, Colours without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders. But obſerve more, that notwithſtanding the Authority of <hi>Livius, Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> and <hi>Vegetius,</hi> who give an Enſign to every Centuriate, <hi>Lipſius</hi> in the eighth Dialogue of his ſecond Book, declares his opinion to be, that a Maniple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of two Centuriates, had but one Enſign. In what <hi>Roman</hi> Authors he<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lipſius</hi> will allow but one Enſign for a Maniple. His Reaſons examined, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Firſt.</note> hath read this I know not, but I am confident he ſaw neither of the two practis'd in his own Countrey, during the whole Wars between the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Eſtates of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which began a little before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to write. But it is fit we hear and anſwer the Reaſons, wherewith he endeavours to confirm his opinion: Firſt, He cites <hi>Varro,</hi> who mentions but one <hi>Signum,</hi> or Banner, in one Maniple. It is anſwer'd, That <hi>Varro</hi> in that place intended not to inform us, whether there were two Enſigns or one, in the Maniple, that not being the ſubject or matter of his diſcourſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he ſpoke of one, he did not deny but there might be two. Secondly,<note place="margin">Second.</note> ſaith <hi>Lipſius,</hi> Since there was but one Eagle in the Legion, there ſhould be but one Banner in the Maniple. Truly, he might as well have ſaid but one Banner in the Cohort, the Analogy would have held as well, if not better. It was the <hi>Romans</hi> plreaſure to have but one Eagle in every Legion, and one Colours in every Centuriate, and the queſtion is <hi>de re geſtâ,</hi> of the thing done, and not of the cauſes and reaſons of the deed it ſelf. Thirdly, he ſaith, <hi>Polybius</hi> ſpeaks of<note place="margin">Third.</note> two <hi>Signiferi,</hi> or Enſign-bearers, but not of two Enſigns. Neither doth that which <hi>Lipſius</hi> adds, help him, that he thinks, the one Enſign-bearer was to relieve the other when he was wearied. To the firſt part of this Reaſon, I ſay it is of no force; for when <hi>Polybius</hi> ſaid, there were two Enſign-bearers, he ſaid in theſe words, There were likewiſe two Enſignes. For if <hi>Lipſius</hi> ſhould ſay, In one Brigade there are two Colonels, would not any man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, That there were two Regiments in that Brigade. To the ſecond part, That the one Enſign-bearer ſerv'd to relieve and eaſe the other; it is but a conjecture of <hi>Lipſius,</hi> and he gueſſeth not always right. For why ſhould there be two Enſign-bearers for one Enſign, ſince there was but one Eagle bearer for one Eagle, which was much heavier, and of more conſequence than an
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97406:45"/> ordinary banner. Fourthly, he tells us that when <hi>Caſar</hi> beat <hi>Pompey</hi> at <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

I wonder why ſo grave a Man as <hi>Lipſius,</hi> would propoſe ſo ridiculous an argument; for firſt <hi>Caſar</hi> got not all <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Eagles, for himſelf writes, that <hi>Pompey</hi> had one hundred and ten Cohorts, theſe made up eleven complete Legions, but <hi>Caſar</hi> got but nine Eagles, and ſo he wanted the two belonging to the other two Legions; and if he had got all the Enſigns that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to thoſe nine Eagles, (reckoning two Enſigns to every Maniple) he had got no fewer than five hundred and forty, or yet (according to <hi>Lipſius</hi> his own account, reckoning but one Banner to every Maniple) if he had got all, he ſhould have got juſt two hundred and ſeventy, yet <hi>Caſar</hi> declares he got no more than one hundred and eighty. What will follow upon all this, but that all the reſt of the Enſigns eſcaped, as well as the two Eagles, or that they were torn or deſtroyed by the Bearers, as is uſual in our own times for Enſigns to do. But he concludes, that whatever the Maniples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the <hi>Principes</hi> and the <hi>Haſtati</hi> had, yet each Century of the <hi>Triarii</hi> had but one Colour, becauſe of their ſmall number, but his conjecture is ill grounded, as not agreeable to ancient ſtory; for it being agreed on, that thirty Men of the <hi>Triarii</hi> ſhould make a Century, that Century ought to have had an Enſign as well as a Century of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Haſtati</hi> or <hi>Principes,</hi> which, according to <hi>Polybius,</hi> conſiſted of ſixty Men, and according to <hi>Vegetius,</hi> of one hundred Men.

                  <p>I hope, if I queſtion the truth of ſome things, which <hi>Lipſius</hi> avers either here, or afterward, it ſhall not be eſteemed arrogance in me, for I reverence the memory of that great and learned Man, but it will, I ſuppoſe, be granted<note place="margin">Apology of the Author.</note> me, that he might eaſily erre in things that belonged not properly to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, though I believe, no one Man hath given greater light, to the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, than he hath done.

                  <p>I believe <hi>Lipſius</hi> conjectures right enough, that in the time of the civil Wars, where Armies were made up of many Legions, and theſe made weak by long and continuated Marches, frequent Sieges and Battels, then I ſay, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, Cohorts were modell'd in one Body, and uſed, as Maniples uſed to be<note place="margin">Cohorts mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalled as Maniples.</note> in more ancient times; yet for all that, I will not grant to <hi>Lipſius,</hi> that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort conſiſted of leſs than ſix Centuries, though they might be very weak, nor yet will I grant, that every one of thoſe ſix Centuries had not its own Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, and Enſign: for as in our Modern Regiments, a Captain is ſtill Captain, though his Company be not twenty ſtrong, and hath Colours always, till the Regiment is broken; ſo among the <hi>Romans</hi> every Century or Ordo had its Centurion and Enſign, till the Legion was diſmiſs'd and disbanded, which was frequently enough done.</p>
                  <p>In every Legion there were ten Cohorts, neither had a Cohort any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular<note place="margin">How many Cohorts in a Legion.</note> Commander over it, more than the Maniple had, ſo as yet, the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion was the higheſt Officer, yea the only Officer in a Legion, except the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, whereof for the moſt part there were ſix in a Legion, be the Legion of what ſtrength it would, yet the Legion was not divided among the Tribunes, nor had any one of them a particular command of any part of it, but all of them, and every one of them had the command of the whole Legion; but to ſhun both confuſion and contention, they commanded about a month by turns, for <hi>Polybius</hi> in his fifth Book informs us, that two Tribunes had the command for one month alternatively; his meaning certainly was, two Tribunes in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſular Army, in which there were two Legions of <hi>Romans,</hi> beſides Allies, and<note place="margin">Military Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes.</note> that is ſtill one Tribune for every Legion, and ſo the Tribunes had their turns, if it be true what <hi>Polybius</hi> ſuppoſes, that the Army ſtaid in the Field but ſix Months, and ordinarily they ſtaid no longer, and ſometimes not ſo long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet we find that ſometimes they ſtaid abroad all the Winter over, the firſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice whereof was at the Siege of <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Here now, you ſee, we have ſix Tribunes in a Legion, and but one Tribune in a Legion. The other five had that ſame reſpect, ſervice, and obedience paid them, with him who commanded, and ſate in the Council of War with the Conſul, as well as he.</p>
                  <p>The power and authority of the Tribunes was great enough, they judged of all cauſes, Civil, Criminal, and Military, but the laſt appeal was reſerved for the Conſul, or General. They might impoſe pecuniary mulcta and fines, and<note place="margin">Their Power.</note> puniſh by defalcation of Pay, or Proviant, and by whipping likewiſe; yea <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius</hi> ſays, they might paſs a ſentence of Death, others ſay, not without the Council. They received the Teſſera, or Watchword from the Conſul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſhall give you a more perfect account in another place. They went<note place="margin">Their Duties.</note>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:97406:46"/> before to ſee the Camp meaſured out, according to the form of the <hi>Roman</hi> Caſtrametation, whereof hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But where theſe Tribunes had their Stations in the time of Battel (for ſure the other five were not idle then) neither <hi>Polybius</hi> nor <hi>Vegetius</hi> tells us one<note place="margin">Their ſtation in Battel.</note> word; Doubtleſs they are to blame, for concealing that, and many other conſiderable points of the <hi>Roman</hi> art of War. And here again, I am forced to engage with <hi>Lipſius,</hi> who very frankly offers his conjecture, which is this; That all the ſix Tribunes ſtood beſide or near the Conſul, and that was, ſaith he, beſide the Eagle on the right hand of the <hi>Triarii;</hi> but if he had remembred of ſome things, that no queſtion he knew, he would not have vented this opinion of his: For, firſt, the Conſul could not be beſide two Eagles, and<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lipſius</hi> erres in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture;</note> therefore the Tribunes of both Legions could not be beſide him. Secondly, The Conſul, as all Hiſtory witneſſeth, was ſo far from being conſtantly at the Eagle, that he was but very ſeldom beſide any of the Eagles, except when he was to lead the <hi>Triarii</hi> up to the aſſiſtance of the other two Claſſes, and many times he did this by a ſign, and not in Perſon. Thirdly, it had been great ſhame for a knot of Colonels to have ſtood all of them beſide the <hi>Triarii,</hi> when the other two Batallions of <hi>Haſtati</hi> and <hi>Principes</hi> were at hot work with an Enemy. Now, the reaſon, which <hi>Lipſius</hi> gives for this gueſs of his, is as extravagant as the conjecture it ſelf, and I pray you, hear it. Becauſe, ſaith he, the Tribunes in the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp quarter'd all very near the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> or<note place="margin">And in the reaſon of it.</note> Conſuls Pavilion: and therefore, that in time of Battel, they ſhould all be beſide or near the Conſul, is an Inference not worthy the youngeſt Novitiate in Logick: for, if this reaſon were valid, then all the Horſemen ſhould have been embattell'd in the rear beſide the <hi>Triarii,</hi> becauſe in the Camp they quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd all beſide them, as you ſhall hear afterwards. But ſince gueſſing is in faſhion, why may not I gueſs too? yes, by <hi>Lipſius</hi> his permiſſion, I think I may. I ſhall loſe but little. My conjecture then ſhall be grounded on two undeniable truths, the firſt is, that the Tribunes had the command of the<note place="margin">The Authors conjecture.</note> Horſe, as well as of the Foot: The ſecond, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſtantly marſhall'd in one Wing, and for the moſt part, in the right Wing, the left one being ordain'd for the Cavalry of the Allies, add a third truth to the other two, that the Horſe had no Officers to command them, but Decurions, and theſe were Independent one of another: Let us then allow one of the ſix Tribunes to command the Horſe. In the next place let us or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two experimented Tribunes to ſtay with the <hi>Triarii,</hi> and the other two to command the <hi>Principes,</hi> and the ſixth with my conſent, ſhall fight with the <hi>Haſtati.</hi> If this conjecture of mine pleaſe the Reader, as little as that of <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> pleaſeth me, I ſhall not break my heart for the matter, for I have met with greater diſappointments.</p>
                  <p>As to any other Officer of the Infantry, in the old <hi>Roman</hi> Militia, I find none. <hi>Vegetius</hi> tells us in the ſeventh Chapter of his ſecond Book, of ſome mean Office<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bearers, who perhaps in his time had ſome ſmall allowance of pay more than ordinary: But in <hi>Polybius</hi>'s time, and before it, they were nothing but <hi>Gregarii Milites,</hi> common Souldiers; and we are now ſpeaking of the ancient conſtitutions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia. But with <hi>Vegetius</hi> I ſhall ſpeak a word of theſe meaner Office-beaters. <hi>Teſſerarii,</hi> who received the word from the<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Teſſerarii,</hi> what. <hi>Metatores,</hi> what. <hi>Menſores,</hi> what. <hi>Clerks.</hi>
                     </note> Tribunes. <hi>Metatores</hi> went before with the Tribune to meaſure out the Camp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Menſores,</hi> who in the Field gave the Souldiers ground for their Huts and Tents, and their ſeveral Lodgings in Towns and Villages, as our Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters and Fouriers do. <hi>Librarii</hi> were petty Clerks and Scriveners, who kept the accounts of Pay, proviant, and donatives; all theſe in ancient times were appointed and choſen by the Centurions, remaining ſtill common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and changed at their pleaſure. In that ſame Chapter <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Ordinarii, Qui in pralio primos ordines ducunt,</hi> who in Battel, ſaith he, led the firſt orders. But here, to me he is very obſcure, for <hi>Ordines</hi> may ſignifie <hi>Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ordinares,</hi> what.</note> which is not meant in this place; <hi>Ordines</hi> ſignifies Centuriates, and ſo <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaubon</hi> in his tranſlation of <hi>Polybius</hi> uſeth it, and <hi>Ordines</hi> is very often taken for both Ranks and Files. If <hi>Vegetius</hi> had uſed <hi>Ordines</hi> here for Centuriates, then aſſuredly he would have ſaid the <hi>Ordinarii</hi> were the <hi>Principes,</hi> or of them, for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97406:46"/> according to his account, the <hi>Principes</hi> made the firſt Batallion, and ſo were <hi>Primi ordines,</hi> that is, the firſt Centuriates. But if by <hi>Ordines</hi> he meant Ranks, as all along he ſeems to do, then his <hi>Primi ordines,</hi> or firſt ranks, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but File-leaders, whereof, indeed the Centurion himſelf was one, and the Dignity he had, was, that he marched and fought either on the right or left hand of his own Centuriate, as when two were joyned in a Maniple, the oldeſt Centurion ſtood on the right hand of the Maniple, and the youngeſt on the left. It is there alſo, where the ſame Author tells us, of ſome who were called <hi>Auguſtales,</hi> that were joyned to theſe <hi>Ordinarii,</hi> but he makes it not<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Auguſtals,</hi> what.</note> clear to us, what duty they did, nor could they at all belong to the Ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Militia, having been but ordain'd by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> from whom they had their Denomination.

                     <hi>Simplares,</hi> and <hi>Duplares,</hi> were ſuch as had received gold Chains, or Bracelets, ſingle or double, as rewards of their Valour, Vertue and good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, who beſides had many times given them a double allowance of Bread, Fleſh, and Wine: All theſe were nothing but common Souldiers, who enjoy'd ſuch benefits as theſe we have ſpoke of; and perhaps were not priviledged<note place="margin">All of them common Souldiers.</note> from the Duties of thoſe Souldiers, who were called <hi>Munifices,</hi> whereof I ſpoke formerly. As to <hi>Vegetius</hi> his Trumpeters and Horn-winders, whereof he ſpeaks in that ſame place, I ſhall have a Diſcourſe of them in a Chapter apart.</p>
                  <p>It is there likewiſe, where <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſpeaks of the Creation of Tribunes,<note place="margin">Tribunes.</note> who, he ſaith, were choſen by the Emperors, after they were veſted with the Soveraign Power, and had their authority given them <hi>per Epiſtolam ſacram,</hi> which I may engliſh by an Imperial Patent, or Commiſſion. But in my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Election, I have ſhown you, who uſed to chuſe the Tribunes after the Ancient <hi>Roman</hi> way. And in the ſame Chapter it is, that our Author qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies thoſe (whom <hi>Livy</hi> calls <hi>Subcenturiones,</hi> and <hi>Caſaubon</hi> out of <hi>Polybius, Agmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Coactores</hi>) with the name of <hi>Optiones,</hi> they ſignifie all one thing, and I think,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Options,</hi> what.</note> Bringers up: yet among theſe Rear-men there was one, who was choſen by the Centurion to aſſiſt him, and this was the Sub-Centurion, our Lanceſpeſate, if he was ſo much. But I pray you, take notice how <hi>Vegetius</hi> deſcribes theſe Perſons: <hi>Optiones ab optando appellati, quod antecedentibus agritudine prapeditis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vegetius</hi> his deſcription of them.</note> 
                     <hi>tanquam adoptati eorum, atque Vicarii ſolent univerſa curare, Options,</hi> ſaith he, they were called from wiſhing, or adopting, becauſe thoſe who marched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, being hindred by ſickneſs, they as their adopted and Vicars uſed to have a care of all things. By this deſcription, they were nothing but Bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers up, and all Bringers up could not be Sub-centurions. And at beſt, the Sub-Centurion had all his power from his Centurion, and was, as his adopted Child to ſucceed him in his charge after his death, whether that happen'd by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or a violent way. But ſo far as I can yet perceive, this Sub-Centurion, this <hi>Agminis Coactor,</hi> this <hi>Optio,</hi> this adopted Child, ſignified nothing, nor could officiate any way, till his Father the Centurion dyed, or at leaſt, till he either fell ſick, or chanced to be wounded, and then this Adopted Son of his might ſupply his place, as his Deputy.</p>
                  <p>I find in ſome Authors, that every Legion had a Phyſician, but whether eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Phyſicians &amp; Chirurgions.</note> Centuriate, Maniple or Cohort, had a Chirurgion, I know not, for I find nothing of it in any Author I have read. But ſince nothing is more certain, than that the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers and Officers were frequently wounded, and that we read of Conſuls and Dictators, who have made it a part of their work (as indeed it was) to viſit, comfort, and cheriſh the ſick and hurt, in their Tents, and Hutts, I think, we need not doubt, but their Armies were well provided of theſe Artiſts, without whoſe help, the comfortable words of a General, nay of a Prince, to a heavily diſeaſed Perſon, could ſignifie but little.</p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:97406:47"/>
                  <p>The Eagle was the Enſign or Banner of every Legion, it being the Arms<note place="margin">The Eagle.</note> of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, as it continues to be to the <hi>German Roman</hi> Emperours to this day. It was carried on the top of a long Pole or Spear, and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to the care and keeping of the firſt Centurion of the Legion, and that was he who commanded on the Right hand of the <hi>Triarii,</hi> but whether he carried it himſelf, or had only the inſpection of it, and was to anſwer<note place="margin">By whom carried.</note> for the loſs of it, I have read no Author who clears me, nor doth <hi>Lipſius</hi> offer me any help. And therefore I ſhall be of the opinion, that the Centurion who had the Command of the Legion next to the Tribunes, ought not to have been hinder'd in the exerciſe of his function, (eſpecially when he was both to fight himſelf, and teach others how to fight) with ſo great a burthen, as was the Eagle, with its long Pole; and till I get better information, I ſhall think that he had ſome other ſtrong luſty fellow to bear it, for the defence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, many Centurions at ſeveral occaſions, loſt their lives. I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that in ancient times the whole Batallion of the <hi>Triarii</hi> was called <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and themſelves <hi>Pilani;</hi> hence it is, that the firſt Centurion of that Claſs (to whom the Eagle was recommended) was called <hi>Primipilus,</hi> and<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Primipilus,</hi> and his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> was the firſt of the whole Legion, to which degree of honour (as being then capable to be a Tribune) he aſcended by many ſteps, as having been a Centurion of, and in all the other two Claſſes before: He had ſome privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, more than other Centurions had; one whereof was, that he might ſit in Council with the Conſul, Legates, and Tribunes. He who carried the Eagle was called <hi>Aquilifer,</hi> or Eagle-bearer; who ſtill, I think, could not be the <hi>Primipilus,</hi> of whom <hi>Vegetius</hi> in the eighth Chapter of his ſecond Book, ſays only <hi>Aquilae praecrat,</hi> He had the care of the Eagle.</p>
                  <p>The other Enſigns or Banners, of which I ſaid every Centuriate had one,<note place="margin">Enſigns.</note> and conſequently every Maniple two, were called <hi>Signa,</hi> Signs or Enſigns; for anciently <hi>Vexillum</hi> belong'd properly to the Horſe, and was that which we now call a Standard, though ſome Authors in later times have confounded <hi>Vexillum</hi> and <hi>Signum,</hi> and make them both ſignifie one thing. In theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of old, were drawn the Pictures of their Heatheniſh Gods, as likewiſe of ſome Beaſts and Birds, as of a Lion, a Tyger, or a Dragon, to ſtir them up to courage, fury, revenge, and bloodſhed; particularly, the Wolf was not forgot in their Colours, to denote, I think, that the founder of their City was nurſed by one of them. After the State was changed into a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, ordinarily they had in their Banners, the Pictures and Images of their Emperours: And <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſpeaking of them in the ſeventh Chapter of<note place="margin">Images.</note> his ſecond Book, calls them that carry'd them, <hi>Imaginiferi, qui Imagines Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratorum portare ſolebant:</hi> Image-bearers, who uſed to carry the Images of the Emperours. The Images of thoſe proud and ambitious Princes had a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend kind of Worſhip paid to them. So we read in <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> that <hi>Tiridates,</hi> a <hi>Parthian</hi> Prince, when he had left his own, and came to <hi>Corbulo</hi>'s Army, ador'd <hi>Nero</hi>'s Image. There was a great Banner, not heard of in<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Labarum</hi> the Imperial Standard.</note> ancient times, that they called <hi>Labarum,</hi> which was never carried into the Field, but when the Emperour was perſonally with the Army; this reſembled our Royal Standard.</p>
                  <p>But here is a queſtion. Since all the Centuries in all the three Claſſes had<note place="margin">Anteſignani.</note> Colours, why the <hi>Haſtati</hi> in ſeveral Hiſtories are called <hi>Anteſignani,</hi> as thoſe who march'd before the Colours; and the <hi>Principes, Subſignani,</hi> as thoſe which<note place="margin">And <hi>Poſtſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.</hi>
                     </note> march'd under the Colours; and the <hi>Triarii, Poſtſignani,</hi> as thoſe who march'd after the Colours: which ſeems to import that none of them had Enſigns but the <hi>Principes?</hi> To which is anſwer'd: The Colours of the <hi>Haſtati</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                     <note place="margin">Subſignani.</note> being before the <hi>Triarii,</hi> and their own Colours in the firſt Ranks, the <hi>Triarii</hi> were properly enough called <hi>Poſtſignani.</hi> The <hi>Principes</hi> were <hi>Subſignani,</hi> becauſe with them, ſay ſome, were the principal Colours, and by this ſame<note place="margin">Why ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> Reaſon they will have the <hi>Haſtati</hi> to be <hi>Anteſignani,</hi> becauſe (though they had Enſigns of their own) yet they march'd before the Principal Colours. Indeed we muſt be ſatisfied with this Reaſon, for lack of a better, and truly it is better than that of ſome, who ſay, the <hi>Haſtati</hi> were call'd <hi>Anteſignani,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in time of fight, they ſent back their Enſigns to the <hi>Principes.</hi> This cannot hold, if it be true what we read very often in Hiſtory, that in time
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97406:47"/> of Battel or Aſſault, the Enſigns, ſometimes the Eagle it ſelf, was caſt into the Batallion or Camp of the Enemy, to animate the Souldiers to advance and charge with greater courage and fury to recover their Banners. This differ'd far from ſending them back to the next Claſs of heavy armed.</p>

All others were but Temporary Deputies, without Office or Pay, or elſe priviledged Souldiers, made free from ſome duties, or beneficed with ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natives, for ſome particular pieces of good ſervice performed by them, which did not at all make them Officers; and to aver, they were Officers without Pay, is ſomething ridiculous. Now that none<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had Pay as Officers, but only Tribunes and Centurions (I ſpeak ſtill of the Foot) and that all others had Pay and Donatives only as Common Souldiers, ſhall be, I hope, clear'd by me, in my Diſcourſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pay. That which, indeed, ſtumbles me moſt is, that the Enſign-bearers were not reckon'd to be Officers, and I conceive this hath been a neglect in both <hi>Vegetius</hi> and <hi>Polybius,</hi> that they have not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us right information of that matter. For I cannot but ſuppoſe, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> did aſſuredly give to their Enſigns ſome more than ordinary allowance for carrying the Colours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially, ſince the third part of the Souldiers Pay and Booty, and of their Largeſſes and Donatives too, was depoſited in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns hands, or at the Colours, till the time of the Souldiers Diſmiſſion; of which hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Yet on the other hand, to my beſt underſtanding, <hi>Caſar</hi> doth not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any Foot Officer or Commander in a Legion, or in the Army, but Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes and Centurions. Hear himſelf in two ſeveral places: The firſt is, in his firſt Book of the Civil War, where he ſays, The Chieftain ſwore firſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him the Tribunes, after them the Centurions; and then, ſaith he, the Souldiers by Centuries.

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry, and all its Officers.</head>
                  <p>WE have but a ſlender account given us of the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe by <hi>Vegetius.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The ſum of what <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſaith of the Horſe.</note> All he ſaith on that Subject amounts to this: In the fourteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Second Book, he ſays, As a Band of Foot is called a Century or a Maniple, ſo a Company of Horſe is called a <hi>Turma,</hi> that is, a Troop: That every one of theſe Troops conſiſted of thirty two Riders, whereof the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander was called a Decurion, and he deſcribes him to have been a perſon not only well Arm'd and Hors'd, and active and expert in all feats of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, but able to teach his Troopers to be ſo likewiſe, and to keep their Arms bright and clean, and their Horſes in good caſe. In the twenty third Chapter of his third Book, he informs us, that the Cataphract Horſe-men, or Cuiraſſiers, arm'd at all pieces, are free from Wounds (how could this be, when their Faces were not covered?) but were not able, ſaith he, to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do great matters, becauſe of the heavineſs of their Armour, yet good at cloſe fight, either before the Foot, or mixed with them, to beat a Batallion of an Enemy. This is all. So we remain ignorant (till he come to marſhal his Legion) of<note place="margin">Omiſſions of <hi>Vegetius.</hi>
                     </note> the ſtrength of the Cavalry, and even then, for him, we know not how the Horſe-men were levied o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> elected, how they were paid, how they watched, or what other duties they were bound to do, how deep they were marſhall'd, when and where they marched, or fought, what diſtances were between their Ranks and Files; and what Intervals between their <hi>Turmes,</hi> or Troops. Let us ſee how <hi>Polybius</hi> will help us in all, or in any of theſe.</p>
                  <p>In his ſixth Book he ſays, In old times two hundred Horſe were aſſign'd for every Legion, and theſe were elected, after the Foot were levied; but in his<note place="margin">Election of the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> own time, and long before it, three hundred Horſe were appointed for every Legion, and were elected before the Foot; and elected they were not by the Conſuls or Tribunes, as the Foot were, but by the Cenſor. This is all <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> ſaith of their election. Out of Hiſtory we find that the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe-men were all of the <hi>Equeſtral</hi> Dignity, that is, Gentlemen; yet in ancient times they ſerv'd on Horſes bought at the publick charges, and when any of them committed groſs faults, their Horſes were taken from them, which was juſtly accounted an ignominy. Thereafter when they came to ſerve on their own Horſes, (yet on the publick wages) there was a luſtration, or muſter of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the Cenſors pleas'd, but ordinarily it was once in five years, of all thoſe of that Rank, who were able, both for their Perſons and their Purſes, to ſerve on Horſe-back, and then they rode in State on the beſt Horſes, and in the beſt equipage they were able to procure, and paſt by the place where the Cenſors ſate as Judges. All thoſe who could be accus'd of no Miſdemeanour, rode on without interruption, but ſuch as the Cenſors could charge with enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous crimes, were ſtopp'd, and commanded to ſell their Horſes, which was no ſmall diſgrace to them. And this Muſter, or Show, was called <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectio.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tranſvectio.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the Duties of their Horſe-men, their Guards and Watches, and of their Pay, <hi>Polybius</hi> ſpeaks not much, I ſhall ſay ſomething of each of them in their proper places. He ſpeaks a little of the Diſtance between Troops, of which I ſhall treat in my Diſcourſe of Intervals.</p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Polybius</hi> avers, That the three hundred Horſe, levied or elected<note place="margin">Firſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Polybi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Vegeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
                     </note> for each Legion, were divided into ten Troops, every one whereof conſiſted of thirty Riders, which made up compleatly three hundred Horſe. Here <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius</hi> and <hi>Vegetius</hi> differ, the laſt allowing thirty two Horſe-men to a Troop, and the firſt but thirty; for certainly in Companies of ſo ſmall a number, two
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97406:48"/> made a conſiderable difference. Out of theſe thirty Riders, ſays <hi>Polybius,</hi> three <hi>Prafecti</hi> were choſen, by whom he tells not, but lets us ſuppoſe by the Conſul, or ſome of the Tribunes. He on the Right Hand had the command of the Troop: In his abſence, he on the Left Hand had it; and he not being preſent, the third did officiate. Theſe three choſe three others, to be <hi>Agminis,</hi> or <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae Coactores,</hi> for ſo <hi>Caſaubon</hi> renders it in <hi>Latin.</hi> The firſt Elected <hi>Praefectus,</hi> was called <hi>Turmae Ductor,</hi> the Leader of the Troop; the other two were called <hi>Decuriones,</hi> and I ſuppoſe one of them carried the <hi>Vexillum</hi> or Banner, though <hi>Polybius</hi> tells us nothing of it: And yet it ſhould not have been omitted, ſince every Troop had a Standard. Now by this reckoning of <hi>Polybius,</hi> ſo weak a Troop was but a Caporalſhip, and he who commanded it but a Caporal: The two other Decurions but Leaders of Files, and the three <hi>Agminis Coactores</hi> but Bringers up. For we do not find that any one of them was ſupernumerary, but the contrary, that all of them were members of the Troop, and elected out of the number of the thirty; ſo that without thoſe ſix, <hi>Polybius</hi> his <hi>Turmae</hi> were but twenty four ſtrong: Nor ſhall you find that any greater Pay was allowed to any of theſe ſix, than to the other four and twenty. And this difference is alſo to be obſerved between <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Vegetius,</hi> that the firſt ſpeaks of three Decurions, and as many Sub-Decurions, the laſt only of one Decurion. Nor<note place="margin">Second diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> indeed do I find at all any warrant in Hiſtory, for <hi>Vegetius</hi> his thirty two Riders, ſince all agree, that for moſt part three hundred Horſe were levied with each Legion, and theſe three hundred divided into ten <hi>Turmas,</hi> which made thirty for each Troop. But we ſhall examine how he diſpoſeth of theſe two ſupernume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Riders, when we come to ſpeak of his Legion.</p>
                  <p>How deep, or how many in File theſe Troops were, none of our Tacticks<note place="margin">Deepneſs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe not told us.</note> directly write; no more than they do of the depth or the heighth of the Foot. An inexcuſable overſight: For without the knowledge of that, we can neither know nor gueſs what ground a Maniple, Cohort, Troop, or Legion, could or might take up. <hi>Vegetius</hi> gives us ſome ground to conjecture, that in his opinion the Foot were eleven in File: For in the laſt Chapter of his ſecond Book, (as I obſerved before) he ſaith, for every Carrobaliſt, Mules were appointed to draw it, and to manage and have a care of it, a <hi>Contubernium</hi> of Soldiers, that is, ſaith he, eleven men. This will not poſitively make eleven in File, yet it gives a ſtrong preſumption, that <hi>Vegetius</hi> thought ſo, which if he did, and that it was ſo indeed, all Maſters of the Military Art have taken up their meaſures wrong, in appointing Foot Files to be of even and equal numbers, as ſixteen, twelve, ten, eight, and ſix. As to the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe, ſome may have miſtaken <hi>Polybius,</hi> who think he inſinuates, they were marſhall'd eight in File: For who will conſider right what he writes, will find that in that place he ſpoke not at all of the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry. The paſſage is in the twelfth Book of his Hiſtory; where he puts himſelf to much trouble, to demonſtrate the vanity and abſurdity of<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Polybius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Caliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenes.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Caliſthenes,</hi> his Relation of that great Battel fought in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> between <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> where that Hiſtorian ſaith, that the <hi>Perſian</hi> King marched with thirty thouſand Horſe in Battel, and called up his mercenaries to him, who were as many: All this in a ground not above fourteen <hi>Stadia</hi> or Furlongs in Latitude, which makes but one <hi>Italian</hi> mile and three quarters: As alſo that <hi>Alexander</hi> marched in Battel with his whole Foot forty <hi>Stadia,</hi> five <hi>Italian</hi> miles, in an uneven, woody, and broken ground. The impoſſibility of both which, <hi>Polybius,</hi> as an experienced Captain, undertakes to demonſtrate. And this he could not do, unleſs he had firſt conſidered how deep the Horſe were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall'd; otherwiſe he could not know of what Longitude the front of thirty thouſand Horſemen would be, whether they would require more ground than the fourteen Furlongs allowed by <hi>Caliſthenes,</hi> as no doubt they did. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he agrees on eight deep; his words are theſe: In juſt Battels, ſaith he, the Horſe Battalion is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo ordered for moſt part, that its deepneſs conſiſted of eight Riders. Now firſt he ſaith, for moſt part, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t plurimum,</hi> not always; for indeed I doubt not but he knew well enough, it was not always ſo. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he ſpeaks there of <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Gracian</hi> Armies, and what he ſays of the deepneſs of their Horſe Squadrons, cannot be appropriated to the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry. But he concludes at eight deep, eight hundred Horſe would take up in<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Perſian</hi> Horſe eight deep.</note> front one hundred and twenty five Paces, which is one Furlong; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97406:49"/> eight thouſand Horſe needed to have for their Front twelve hundred and fifty paces, that is ten Furlongs: And therefore <hi>Darius</hi> his thirty thouſand Horſe being eight deep, would in Front have poſſeſs'd of ground four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred eighty ſix paces, more than thirty ſeven <hi>Stadia</hi> or Furlongs, and theſe will make more than four <hi>Italian</hi> miles and a half; and as much ground <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> muſt have allowed to his Mercenaries. Obſerve here, that <hi>Polybius</hi> allows for one hundred Horſe in Front one hundred twenty five paces, which is more than ſix foot for a Horſe-man to ſtand on, and for diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his ſide-man.</p>
                  <p>But if <hi>Polybius</hi> his meaning be, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe were marſhall'd eight<note place="margin">We know not how deep the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe were.</note> deep, then <hi>Vegetius</hi> his thirty two Riders will do better than <hi>Polybius</hi> his thirty in a Troop, becauſe thirty two will make four Files compleatly, whereas thirty makes but three Files of eight, and a broken one of ſix. In ſuch a miſt do theſe two great Maſters of the <hi>Roman</hi> Art of War leave us, out of which neither accurate <hi>Lipſius,</hi> or any other of my reading hath offer'd to guide us. I conceive, according to thirty in a Troop, ten deep might hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> done well, and who can tell but <hi>Polybius</hi> meant ſo, when he appoints three Decurions to be File-leaders, and three <hi>Agminis</hi> or <hi>Turma Coactores,</hi> to be Bringers up. But that was indeed too many, it making the Longitude or Front ſo ſmall, as render'd it very eaſie to be environ'd or ſurrounded.</p>
                  <p>In theſe very ancient times, many Nations fought on Horſes, neither<note place="margin">Unbridled &amp; Unſaddled Horſes.</note> Bridled nor Saddled, and ſome had Saddles, but no Bridles; hence we read, that the <hi>Africans,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Numidians,</hi> divided their Cavalry <hi>in Fraenatos, &amp; Infranatos equos,</hi> into Bridled, and Unbridled Horſes: And it is a wonder, to read in <hi>Livy</hi> with what dexterity and agility theſe unbridled Horſes were rul'd and manag'd by the Hand, the Foot, or Rod of a Rider. Some again had Bridles for their Horſes, but no Saddles; ſo had the <hi>Germans,</hi> who laugh'd at the <hi>Romans,</hi> as ſoft and effeminate, for riding on Saddles; and yet theſe very Saddles which the <hi>Romans</hi> uſed, were nothing but a covering made of ſome piece of Cloath or Stuff, rich or mean, according to the quality of the Rider, or at beſt, of ſome bundle ty'd together for the eaſe of the Horſe-man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Iron or Timber in it, as our Saddles have; neither had any of them<note place="margin">Saddles not ancient.</note> any Stirrups, to eaſe the Riders Legs, for theſe came firſt in faſhion in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time, if <hi>Lipſius</hi> his obſervation holds. Any thing of that nature that was uſed before, was but a Ladder of Cords, Wood, or Iron, to help the Horſe-man to mount his Horſe, if he were aged, indiſpoſed, ſick or lame; and ſo ſoon as he was on Horſe-back the Ladder was remov'd; perhaps not unlike to thoſe Iron Ladders of two or three ſteps high, uſed over all the <hi>Netherlands</hi> for Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to get up to their Waggons. Hiſtory tells us, that <hi>Maſiniſſa,</hi> King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> when he was fourſcore years old, or near that age, could mount his Horſe, without the help of any Stirrup or Ladder. And certainly, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Romans,</hi> but all other Nations were taught to get on Horſe-back with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of them, as now youths are taught in Academies, and did ride (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ur'd to it by cuſtome) with as much eaſe without Stirrups, as we do now with them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> ſometimes caus'd their Cavalry to unbridle their Horſes to<note place="margin">To charge with Unbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled Horſes.</note> make a furious charge, which often ſucceeded well. <hi>Livy</hi> in his eighth Book ſays, it was practis'd againſt the <hi>Volſcians</hi> with ſucceſs: And in his fortieth Book, he gives us the relation of a Battel the <hi>Celtiberians</hi> fought in <hi>Spain</hi> againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Praetor <hi>Fulvius,</hi> wherein the <hi>Romans</hi> were very near worſted, the Enemy having caſt himſelf in a Wedge (at which manner of fight he was thought almoſt invincible) bore down all before him, till the Praetor told his Horſe-men, that charging deſperately on unbridled Horſes might recover the Victory; for, ſaid he, formerly ſuch a practice hath produced good effects. The Cavalry obey'd his order, and by a furious charge with Lances, routed the <hi>Celtiberians.</hi> Such a command in our time would be accounted both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable and ridiculous; yet we may believe, that Horſes were ſo taught and manag'd then, that they would obey their Maſters without Bridles; and this we may ſuppoſe not to be impoſſible, the Rider making uſe of his hands; but truly, I think it ſomething ſtrange to read, that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> could ride great<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> an expert Horſe-man.</note> Horſes, without a Bridle at the full gallop, with his hands claſped together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his back.</p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:97406:49"/>
                  <p>Sometimes the <hi>Roman</hi> Generals, when they ſaw an Enemy prevailing, have brought their Cavalry, or a part of it, to the place of danger, and caus'd them to alight from their Horſes, and fight afoot with their Swords. This both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced the Battel, and mightily encourag'd the Foot, by ſeeing that thoſe who might have ſav'd themſelves by flight, reſolv'd to live and dye with them. Authors do not inform us how they diſpos'd of their Horſes when they came to the Foot Combate; but I ſhall imagine they did not let them go whither they pleas'd, but either appointed their ſervants (if they had any) or ſome of their own number to look after them; and I ſuppoſe alſo, they alighted before they came to the place where they were to fight, for ſhunning confuſion, and putting their own Foot in diſorder. <hi>Caeſar,</hi> before he began his Battel with the <hi>Switzers,</hi> made all his Horſe-men diſmount, and appointed them their<note place="margin">Horſe-men fight on Foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> ſtations, where they were to fight afoot; and to ſhew them a good example, he alighted firſt himſelf, and ſent away all the Horſes a good way from his Army, thereby to encourage his Legionary Foot, and make his Horſe-men know that their ſafety depended only on their own valour. But I believe he gave order that the Horſes ſhould be brought back ſo ſoon as the Enemy was perceiv'd to fly; for we find he and his Cavalry were ſoon remounted, and follow'd the chace very far: And I know no reaſon why it may not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd alſo, that he kept ſome on Horſe-back by him, to carry all the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he gave, to the ſeveral Bodies of his Army in time of the Battel, which himſelf fighting on foot, could not perform. <hi>Gracchus</hi> (betrayed by his Hoſt) being environ'd by an ambuſh of <hi>Hannibalians,</hi> alighted, and fought well for his life, though he loſt it: But I think, he ſhould rather have hazarded to break through on Horſe-back to get to his own party, which was not far off, ſince death would ſtill have been the worſt of it. This ſtory you may read in <hi>Livy</hi>'s twenty fifth Book. Though this practice ſucceeded well ſometimes, yet was it unfortunately attempted by the Conſul <hi>Aemilius,</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Cannae;</hi> for after <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> had routed him and his Horſe on the Right Wing, he made his Horſe-men alight, and fight on foot among the Legionaries, as <hi>Livy</hi> tells us in that twenty fifth Book. And it would ſeem that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that great Captain, did not approve this cuſtome; for the ſame Author ſays, when it was told him what the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul had done, he ſhould have ſmil'd, and ſaid, He might as well have deliver'd them to me bound hand and foot.</p>
                  <p>I know not, if in our Modern Militia, this could be advantageouſly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd, being the Arms of our Horſe and Foot differ very much, whereas thoſe of the <hi>Romans</hi> were almoſt all one. I have indeed ſeen at the aſſaults of Towns, Horſe-men commanded to alight, and ſtorm with the Foot: And this hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it, in regard that with their Piſtols, Carabines, and Swords, they were as able for that ſervice as the Infantry. Yet <hi>Machiavelli</hi> (who will needs<note place="margin">Machiavelli</note> reform the Modern Militia, and caſt it in his own Mould) gives us an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that it was practis'd in the Field, a very little before his own time, and long after that Gun-powder had mightily alter'd the face of War. In the ſecond Book of his Art of War, The Count of <hi>Carmignola,</hi> General for the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> had ſix thouſand Men of Arms, and but a few Foot; with theſe he fought a Battel againſt the <hi>Switzers,</hi> arm'd with long and ſtrong Pikes, and is by them worſted, and forced to quit the Field. The Earl finding what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage a Pike had againſt Horſe, preſented them once more Battel, but coming near, he order'd his Cuiraſſiers to alight (in imitation belike of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar,</hi> fighting againſt the ſame Nation) and fighting on foot, then, ſaith he, the <hi>Switzers</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>es not being able to pierce the Corſlets of the men of Arms, they were totally routed by <hi>Carmignola.</hi> Was it not well, that the ſtrong Pikes of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> puſh'd by their robuſt Arms and Bodies, did not overthrow the Earls Cuiraſſiers, though the points of them could not pierce their Armour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> tells us, that at the confus'd Battel of <hi>Montleberry,</hi> between <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh, King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Charles the Warlike,</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy:</hi> The ſaid <hi>Charles</hi> commanded many of his Gentlemen, who were Men at Arms, to alight from their Horſes, and joyn in fight with his Archers of Foot. Which action (ſays the Author) was honourable, and encourag'd others; and this
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97406:50"/> cuſtome (ſays the ſame <hi>Philip</hi>) the <hi>Burgundians</hi> had learn'd from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when both of them, being Confederates, waged War together againſt <hi>France</hi> for the ſpace of thirty two years, without any truce.</p>
                  <p>The cuſtome, which the <hi>Romans</hi> had to mix Foot with Horſe, begun at the<note place="margin">Horſe and Foot mix'd together</note> Siege of <hi>Capua,</hi> was ſo frequent afterward, that I need not give many inſtances of it. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſeldome fail'd to do it. When <hi>Vercingentorix</hi> had rais'd all <hi>Gaule</hi> about his ears, he ſent for <hi>German</hi> Horſe and Foot, who were accuſtom'd to fight one in company of the other, as he tells us in the ſeventh Book of his <hi>Gallick</hi> War. In <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> finding himſelf far inferiour in Horſe to <hi>Pompey,</hi> he conſtantly mixed ſome of his <hi>Anteſignani</hi> (who were Legionaries, and heavy<note place="margin">practis'd by <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
                     </note> armed, and of the youngeſt ſort, and ſo more able to march and run) with his Horſe; who became ſo expert in that manner of fight, that, as himſelf witneſſeth in his third Book of the Civil War, two hundred of his Horſe joyn'd with the like number of theſe Foot, were not afraid to buckle with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of his Enemies Cavalry. And it was with that manner of fight, that he made that honourable retreat of his from <hi>Dirrachium,</hi> in ſpite of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s whole Army that purſu'd him. And it was with the aſſiſtance of ſix Cohorts of his <hi>Triarian</hi> Foot, that his Horſe beat his Competitors Cavalry at <hi>Pharſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and got him the Victory, as himſelf both confeſs'd and foretold. At <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zita</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> when he offer'd to fight againſt <hi>Scipio, Pompey</hi>'s Father-in-law, he drew up all his Cavalry on his Left Wing, and with them mixed all his light armed Foot, who, it ſeems, were Auxiliaries. The <hi>German</hi> Horſe-men<note place="margin">And by the ancient <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
                     </note> uſed every one of them to chuſe a Foot-man, whom they knew to be ſtout, ſtrong, and ſwift: Theſe Foot-men either skirmiſh'd before the Horſe, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did at <hi>Capua;</hi> or fought in company with them; or ſtood at a diſtance behind them, that the Horſe might retire to them; and if both were forc'd to quit the Field, then the Foot-men laid hold on the Manes of the Horſes, and with that help run as faſt as the Horſe gallopp'd, till both came to their main Body; of all which <hi>Caeſar</hi> informs us in the firſt Book of the <hi>Gallick</hi> War. And this manner of fight was practis'd by <hi>Arioviſtus,</hi> King of <hi>Germany,</hi> and by <hi>Vercingentorix.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We find in Hiſtory, that when the <hi>Romans</hi> were to give Battel, aſſiſted by<note place="margin">

Once <hi>Scipio</hi> at <hi>Zama</hi> gave the Right Wing to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaniſſa,</hi> King of the <hi>Numidians,</hi> and appointed <hi>Lelius</hi> to command the Left Wing, compos'd of <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe. But when they fought without Allies, then their Horſe were drawn up on both Wings; and ſometimes, as I have ſaid, interlin'd with Foot; but ſcarce, or rather never, did I read in any anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Hiſtory, that they were marſhall'd by Troops among the Legionary Foot, whereof I ſhall tell you more hereafter, when I come to ſpeak of <hi>Vegetius</hi> his Legion.

                  <p>SInce we have now ſpoke of both Foot and Horſe, it is fit we know to what Martial Inſtrument or Sound both ſhould hearken. I find <hi>Tubicines,</hi> theſe were Trumpeters; <hi>Cornicines,</hi> theſe were Horn-winders; and <hi>Buccinatores,</hi> who, I think, uſed the Horns of Cows and Oxen; and the <hi>Claſſicu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> All theſe were common to both Horſe and Foot, neither had the one any title to pretend to either of theſe, more than the other had; nor were any of them peculiar to the one more than to the other, though now the Horſe Troops ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate the Trumpet to themſelves, as the Foot do the Drum.</p>
                  <p>The Trumpet is an ancient Inſtrument of War; at firſt, and I believe, for<note place="margin">Trumpeters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> many ages, made of Braſs; hence the Poet, <hi>Aere ciere Vir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s,</hi> though the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of after-ages made their compoſition of Silver. We find they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to almoſt all Nations not long after the deluge, and frequently uſed by a very ancient people; and which is more, by a people choſen and beloved of him, who promulgated his Law to them by ſound of Trumpet, as well as by the dreadful noiſe of his <hi>Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hereal</hi> Cannon. But as it was uſed in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſound the praiſes of the Higheſt, by the Prieſts, who all, or moſt of them, had the skill of a Trumpet: So was it uſed in the time of War with their malignant neighbours; but which was worſe, too much made uſe of by them for Sedition and Rebellion. <hi>To your Tents, O' Iſrael:</hi> Words, which with the preceding ones, have ſounded loud enough in our own ears, and in our own days.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grecians</hi> learned the uſe of the Trumpet from the <hi>Tirenians,</hi> and theſe having their name and original from the <hi>Tirians,</hi> had their Trumpets alſo from them. The <hi>Tirians</hi> being near neighbours to the <hi>Jews,</hi> learned many things of them, and probably the Trumpet likewiſe. The <hi>Greeks</hi> had the uſe of the Trumpet in <hi>Homer</hi>'s time, for he ſpeaks of it in his Poems: Yet it ſeems they knew nothing of it at the Siege of <hi>Troy,</hi> elſe that Great Poet would have made mention of it in his Verſes. This famous War of <hi>Troy</hi> fell out to be in the days of <hi>Jephte,</hi> Judge of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and who knows but the fable of <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s unwilling attempt to ſacrifice his Daughter <hi>Iphigenia</hi> to <hi>Diana,</hi> in whoſe room came a Hart to be a voluntary offering, was borrowed by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity from the true Story of <hi>Jephte</hi>'s vowing to ſacrifice the firſt thing met him without the doors of his houſe; which chanc'd to be his only Daughter. But be that as it will, certain enough it is, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> made uſe of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets three hundred years before either <hi>Jephte</hi> fought with the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> or the <hi>Grecians</hi> beſieg'd <hi>Troy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The uſe of the Trumpet is ſtill retain'd, and in probability will, till the laſt Trumpet ſummon proud man to ariſe from the duſt, and give an account to his great Creator, why he made ſo much uſe of that Martial Inſtrument for the deſtruction of his fellow Creatures. <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſays in the twenty ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his ſecond Book, that the Trumpet was ſounded by the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they went out to War, and when they were commanded to retire; as alſo when the Souldiers were called out to any work or labour impoſed upon them, whether it were to fortifie themſelves by Ditch or Rampart, or to make their marches either Ambulatory or Curſory. Briefly, The Trumpet required the Souldiers to move, but not the Enſigns, Standards, or Baggage.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cornicines,</hi> or Horn-winders, were thoſe who ſounded on Inſtruments<note place="margin">Horn-wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> made in the faſhion of Horns, and, I doubt not, but in the Infancy of that Empire, they were no other but real Horns, ſuch, perhaps, nay, without all peradventure, ſuch as Swine-herds ſound to gather together their herds. Yet
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97406:51"/> theſe Horns, we muſt confeſs, gather'd theſe men together, who overcame Armies, ſubdued Nations, ſubverted Kingdomes, and deſtroyed Cities; but the honour over all Horns was given to that of the Ram, by the miraculous ſound whereof the Walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> were laid equal with the ground. At the ſound of theſe Horn-winders the Enſigns, Colours, and Standards moved. But in time of Battel both Trumpeters and Horn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>winders ſounded: <hi>Pariter canunt,</hi> ſays <hi>Vegetius</hi> in that ſame place; he might have ſaid the <hi>Buccinatores</hi> too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he had pleaſed. But what difference was between the <hi>Cornicines</hi> and<note place="margin">Buccinatores.</note> theſe <hi>Buccinatores</hi> I know not, for both ſounded on Inſtruments of loud Wind-Muſick, bowed like Horns, unleſs that in the beginning of the Cities increaſe, they were diſtinguiſhed by the real Horns of ſeveral Animals. But <hi>Vegetius</hi> in the eighth Chapter of his third Book, ſays that all the <hi>Roman</hi> guards were ſet by the ſound of Trumpet, and were relieved by the ſound of the Horn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. His words are, <hi>A Tubicine omnes Vigiliae committuntur, &amp; finitis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris à Cornicine revocantur.</hi> Now what is this, but that both the Trumpet ſounded, and the Horn blew at the relief of the Guards? The Trumpet, when four Souldiers went to the Poſt where they were to keep Sentinel a whole Watch, (that was three hours) and the Horn when thoſe that were reliev'd came from their Poſt.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould in the next place tell you what the <hi>Claſſicum</hi> was; and ſhould be<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Claſſicum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> what it was.</note> glad if any Body would tell me what it was. I know <hi>Claſſicum</hi> commonly is taken for a Trumpet ſounding a charge, <hi>Claſſicum canere;</hi> and this hath its riſe from the cuſtome the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls had; when they were to begin the Battel they caus'd the <hi>Claſſicum</hi> to ſound, which immediately was followed by all the Trumpets and Horn Inſtruments of the Army. But for all this, I doubt ſtill whether the <hi>Claſſicum</hi> was an Inſtrument, or the ſound of an Inſtrument, and to ſpeak according to our words of Art, a Point of War; or if it was the noiſe of many Warlike Inſtruments all ſounding one thing at one time: Let us hear <hi>Vegetius,</hi> and I am afraid he will make the matter more obſcure.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vegetius</hi> his deſcription of it.</note> He deſcribes it thus: <hi>Claſſicum appellatur, quod Buccinatores per cornu dicunt, hoc inſigne videtur Imperii, quia Claſſicum canitur Imperatore praeſente, aut cum in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litem capitaliter animadvertitur.</hi> That, ſaith he, is called the <hi>Claſſicum,</hi> which the Horn-winders ſpeak by the Horn. And this, ſays he, ſeems to be an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Soveraign command, becauſe the <hi>Claſſicum</hi> ſounds when the Commander in chief is preſent, or when a Souldier is to be capitally puniſhed. What ſhall we make of all this? If we underſtand not now what the <hi>Claſſicum</hi> is, <hi>Vegetius</hi> will ſay he is not to be blam'd; but for all that, I am, for him, ſtill in the dark. That which the Horn-winders ſpeak by a Horn, is to me very dark language; and yet that language of a Horn muſt be an Enſign of Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial power; and withal, if a Souldier be to be hang'd, he muſt have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that Enſign of Imperial power. <hi>Lipſius,</hi> who ſeldome fails to gueſs,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lipſius</hi> his conjecture of it.</note> and ſometimes hits right, thinks the <hi>Claſſicum</hi> was not one Inſtrument, or yet the ſound of one Inſtrument, but the noiſe of many, whether theſe were Trumpets or Horns, or both, which was one of the badges of Supreme Power; for where there was but one Conſul, there was but one of them; and where two Conſuls were together, there were two of them; and beſides other duties, they ſounded when the Conſuls were at Supper: for this reaſon the famous <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian Aſdrubal,</hi> when he began to ſuſpect that he had to do with two <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls, bid his Guards, Foragers and Waterers of Horſes, take heed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and acquaint him, if they heard two <hi>Claſſicums;</hi> and having learn'd it was ſo, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the Conſul (who he thought was diverted by his Brother <hi>Hannibal</hi>) was joyn'd with the other, with whom alone he conceiv'd his work to be. For my part, I incline to believe, that in Hiſtory it is promiſcuouſly taken for the ſound, and ſometimes for the Inſtrument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one or many, either Trumpets or Horns. They were made uſe of in all Banks and Proclamations. The <hi>Claſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> was an Enſign of Supreme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Command, for by it all the emergent and occaſionary orders of the General were promulgated; and by it both Officers and Souldiers were call'd together to hear the Commander in chief's pleaſure made known to them: And hence it is like, it had its derivation, becauſe by it the three Claſſes of <hi>Haſtati, Princip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Rods and Axes ſignified he had power to ſcourge and behead; theſe were carried by Lictors or Sergeants, whereof a Conſul had twelve, a Proconſul ſix, a Legate as many, a Praetor had I know not how many, for it makes but little to our purpoſe. When <hi>Scipio, Pompey</hi>'s Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law, came with his Legions out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and joyn'd with him in <hi>Theſſaly, Pompey</hi> order'd a <hi>Praetorium</hi> to be erected for him, and that he ſhould have a <hi>Claſſicum;</hi> I ſuppoſe, a knitchel of Rod and Axes too; though <hi>Caeſar</hi> doth not mention the laſt in his Commentary.</p>
                  <p>As the Trumpet was of Braſs, ſo in proceſs of time the <hi>Cornu</hi> and <hi>Buccina</hi> were made of Braſs too, and all the three who ſounded, or winded them, were called <hi>Aeneatores.</hi> Every Troop of Horſe, and every Maniple, if not<note place="margin">Aeneatores.</note> every Century of Foot had one, either a Trumpet, or a Horn, or both. I find not that theſe Trumpeters and Horn-blowers had any greater allowance of Wages, Proviant, or Fodder, for either themſelves or Horſes, than other Horſe-men and Foot-men had (for with the firſt they rode on Horſe-back, and with the ſecond they marched on Foot) at any time; perhaps having ſpent much of their breath in ſounding and blowing, they were eaſed from other works of toil and labour, and thoſe were not a few. Whether the <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina</hi> was ſounded, or rather winded, at the relief of every guard, as <hi>Polybius</hi> ſays it was, ſhall be ſpoke of in my Diſcourſe of Guards and Rounds.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the <hi>Roman</hi> Pay, Proviant, and Donatives.</head>
                  <p>IT is reported of that brave <hi>Athenian Themiſtocles,</hi> that he affirm'd, whoever would ſhape or form the great Monſter of War rightly, muſt begin with his Belly; and therefore before we joyn our Horſe and Foot together, we muſt ſee how they ſhall be maintain'd. The <hi>Romans</hi> were a frugal people, till their ſucceſsful Wars made their City the Treaſure-houſe of the Worlds riches. The Pay they they allow'd their Souldiers was ſparing enough, but <hi>Vegetius</hi> tells us not what it was. I find that three hundred years after the foundation of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Horſe-men ſerv'd on their own charges; they might do it the better, for though their atchievements were often honourable enough, yet their expeditions were but ſhort, for either upon a Victory or a Rout, they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd back to the City. But after the Senate began to look far beyond their ancient limits, wages were allow'd out of the publick Treaſury for both Horſe and Foot. <hi>Polybius</hi> in his ſixth Book informs us, that a Foot Souldier<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Roman</hi> Wages and Proviant.</note> had the allowance of two <hi>Oboli</hi> a day, both which (if I miſtake not) make but one <hi>Engliſh</hi> Penny; and a ſmall meaſure of Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>at: A Centurion had a double allowance, and a Horſe-man the triple of a Foot Souldiers Proviant and Wages, and a meaſure of Barley every month for his Horſe. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to the <hi>Socii,</hi> or Allies, as much Wheat and Barley as they did to their own Souldiers, but they were oblig'd to maintain themſelves with their own
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97406:52"/> Monies. But he tells us alſo, that what Proviant, Clothes, yea, what Arms were given to the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, had rates ſet upon them, and were defal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from their wages. Truly, I ſhould think their pay, at two half-pennies a day, could hardly furniſh them with Meat, much leſs Clothes and Arms;<note place="margin">Severe uſage.</note> or if in that cheap world they could be furniſh'd with all three at that rate, they could not have much Money to ſeek, at leaſt very little to depoſite at their Colours; for this defalcation would indeed make their Pay very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and very unproportionable to the great duty and ſervices exacted from them. But <hi>Lipſius</hi> will mend the matter preſently, by telling us, that many times the State quit the Souldiers freely what they owed for either Arms, Proviant, or Clothes; or if any thing was taken, it was ſo inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, that the Souldier parted with it pleaſantly, and without grumbling. I do not care much to be of <hi>Lipſius</hi> his opinion, though he hath not told us who were his Informers; for <hi>Polybius</hi> is poſitively of another judgement, in that place which I have cited: Nor do I remember, that in any other place of his Hiſtory, he ſpeaks any thing of the <hi>Roman</hi> Wages.</p>
                  <p>Here you may obſerve, what I told you before, that in the <hi>Roman</hi> Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try there were no other Officers, properly ſo called, but Centurions and Tribunes, becauſe all others had but the allowance of common Souldiers, both in Wages and Proviant. A Tribune had the quadruple of a Souldiers Pay. Nor can I find that the <hi>Praefecti,</hi> or Decurions of the Horſe, had any more allowance of either Meat or Money than other Troopers had. The <hi>Grecian</hi> Pay, as to the proportion of it, was like the <hi>Roman,</hi> a Centurion ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Souldiers double allowance, a Horſe-man triple, and a Chiliarch quadruple.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers had a greater encouragement to endure their hard<note place="margin">Pillage.</note> fatigue than Pay, and that was the Plunder and Pillage of a Countrey, a beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Town, Caſtle, or an Enemies Camp. This was not due to them, and many times they got no ſhare of it, in regard, for moſt part, it was brought all to the <hi>Quaeſtor,</hi> or Treaſurers quarters, and ſold; and out of the Monies made by that ſale, the Army was paid their wages, and the overplus was ſent in to the Treaſury of <hi>Rome.</hi> But the Conſul, or General, having the diſpoſing of it all in his power, very often gave it as a largeſs to the Army, either for ſome good ſervice done, or to encourage them to undergo ſome difficult and hard piece of work to be done. Neither had any man liberty to take what he could catch, but all was brought to a publick heap, and ſold by the Treaſurer, and then proportionably divided among all, according to every<note place="margin">A good order.</note> mans quality; a Centurion receiving double that which a Souldier got, a Horſe-man triple, and a Tribune quadruple: So that they who fought in the Field, and they who ſtay'd for the defence of the Camp, they who ſtorm'd a Town, and they who ſtood in Reſerve, ſhared all alike in the Booty.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> gave all their Proviant to their Armies in Corn, and did not trouble themſelves to make it either into Meal or Bread; and in their ſtrict diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, Bakers were all baniſh'd from their Camps, and the Souldiers order'd to grind their Corn themſelves, (Hand mills or Querns being allow'd them for that uſe) and thereafter to bake their own Bread. Many times they took not the pains to do either the one nor the other, but boil'd their Wheat with a little Salt, and ſo eat it up for Pottage. They uſed to carry with them<note place="margin">Their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Meat, And Drink.</note> Lard or Bacon, or ſome other fat, wherewith they ſmear'd their Bread. A little Bottle with Vinegar they bore alſo about with them, with a very ſmall quantity whereof they gave a relliſh to their Water, which was their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry drink, though Wine was not forbidden them; for <hi>Mahomet</hi> had then not intoxicated the World with his Doctrine, nor diſcharged the uſe of the juice of the Grape, which cheriſheth the heart of God and Man. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Souldiers then drank Wine, for it was allow'd them, when conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently it could be got; though Drunkenneſs was a crime ſeldome heard of among them. There were alſo ſometimes Oxen, Sheep, and Beeves divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded among them, for preparing and making ready whereof, in the ſtricteſt time of their Diſcipline, the Souldiers were permitted to carry a Braſs Pot, a Spit, and a Drinking Cup; but I ſuppoſe, one of every kind of theſe uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils were not allowed to every one of the Souldiers, but to a <hi>Contubernium,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Utenſils.</note>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:97406:52"/> or Tent-full of them, whether that conſiſted of ten, eleven, or twelve. It was not permitted to them to dine or ſup when they pleaſed; but it being known by the <hi>Claſſicum</hi> when the Conſul went to Table, the Tribunes went to theirs, and ſo both Centurions and common Souldiers went to dinner with ſound of Trumpet. May not a man ſay, that here was a great deal of more ſtate, than good fare. Thoſe Generals who exercis'd ſtrict diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, appointed their Souldiers to take their dinner ſtanding; marry,<note place="margin">They D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Beſides all this, the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiery had reaſon to expect a Donative from<note place="margin">Donatives at Triumphs.</note> their Victorious Generals, when they enter'd the Imperial City in Triumph. This cuſtome was very commendable; for the Largeſs given to them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited others to carry themſelves gallantly againſt an Enemy, ſince they ſaw that in ſome meaſure, they would be ſharers with the chief Commander, both in Honour and Profit. What was given at that time to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldier, was a rule to the Officer, for a Centurion got double, a Horſe-man triple, and a Tribune quadruple. <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>African,</hi> at his magnificent entry into <hi>Rome,</hi> gave four hundred Aſſes to every Souldier, ſome ſay but forty: if the firſt, it was noble enough, and no more neither; (for it would have amounted but to twenty five ſhillings Sterling) if the laſt, it was contemptible, for it ſignified but half a Crown. <hi>Lucius Aemilius,</hi> who ſubverted the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Monarchy, gave at his Triumph to every Souldier one hundred Seſterces, (which might be about fifteen or ſixteen ſhillings Sterling) and proportionably to the Centurions, Horſe-men, and Tribunes. But beſides the evil effects which many of the Conſuls avarice produc'd, their ambition to bring in great ſumms of Gold and Silver to the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and their vanity to give their Armies Donatives at their Triumphs, ſet them on to the committing many Inſolencies, perfidious, unjuſt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowable Plunders and Cruelties, which makes the names of ſome of the braveſt of them infamous to poſterity. Take one inſtance, <hi>inſtar omnium,</hi> of that ſame <hi>Aemilius</hi> I juſt now ſpake of: The deſire he had to bring the vaſt Treaſure of King <hi>Perſeus,</hi> and all he had ſcrap'd together in <hi>Macedon,</hi> into the <hi>Roman</hi> Treaſury; and withal, to give a Donative to his Army at<note place="margin">A deteſtable action.</note> his Triumph, tempted him (and the temptation prevail'd with him) to plunder the whole Towns of <hi>Epirus,</hi> the people whereof were no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor ever had wrong'd the <hi>Roman</hi> State: And this execrable act he did under truſt, the Inhabitants imagining no ſuch uſage; nor was plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the miſchief he did them, for he ſold their perſons, to the number of one hundred and fifty thouſand of both Sexes for Slaves; and with the Money of that ſale he gave the Donative we ſpake of, to his Army. An action ſo full of baſeneſs, inhumanity, perſidy, and injuſtice, that Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Raleigh</hi> ſaith, If any Hiſtory ſpoke but one word to the contrary, no man would believe it could be true. You may read the ſtory of it in the laſt Book of <hi>Titus Livius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The half of the Donatives were ordinarily depoſited at the Standards<note place="margin">Half of Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited.</note> and Enſigns, to be kept there for the uſe of the Souldiers till their diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, leſt they ſhould idly or vainly ſpend it. This reaſon was ſufficient and ſtrong enough; but there was another, and it was this, that the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers knowing a part of their ſtock and ſubſtance to be beſide the Colours, they ſhould never deſert them, but manfully fight for the defence of that, in the preſervation whereof they were ſo deeply concern'd. Though this was certainly a very prudent order, yet I cannot conſent to what <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſaith of it in the twentieth Chapter of his ſecond Book, that it was <hi>ab An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquis divinitus inſtitutum:</hi> For he ſhould have remember'd, that he wrote of the Heathen <hi>Romans,</hi> and himſelf having the knowledge of the true God, he knew likewiſe, that the beſt of their Ordinances were but of Humane, and not Divine Inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>In that ſame Chapter <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſays, that every Legion had ten bags, for the keeping this moyety of the Donatives; that is, a bag for every Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97406:53"/> and an eleventh bag there was, in which every Souldier caſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing once a month, and that was reſerv'd for the Burial of thoſe Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who were able to leave nothing for their Interment. A very laudable cuſtome, for the Burial of the Dead was ever in all Nations in high requeſt.<note place="margin">Burial of the Dead.</note> Truce for ſome days or hours to Inter the ſlain, was ſeldome or never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd by the moſt imbitter'd Enemy. <hi>Hannibal</hi> beſtow'd Burial on his Enemy <hi>Marcellus:</hi> And his Brother <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> at the deſire of <hi>Scipio,</hi> buried thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> Tribunes whom he had kill'd in Battel. And <hi>Juſtin</hi> in his ſixth Book tells us, that when the <hi>Grecians</hi> deſir'd liberty to bury their dead, it was a tacite ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement that they were overcome. But <hi>Vegetius</hi> will have theſe Bags to be kept by the <hi>Signiferi,</hi> the Enſign-bearers, whom therefore he will have not only to be faithful and truſty men, but learned, that they might perfectly keep the accounts of all that was conſign'd in their hands. And here indeed he is (as <hi>Lipſius</hi> in another place calls him) <hi>ſolutus &amp; negligens;</hi> having forgot that in the ſeventh Chapter of his ſecond Book he told us, that the <hi>Romans</hi> had <hi>Librarii,</hi> Notaries or Scriveners, who kept the account of all that belong'd to the Souldiery; therefore not the <hi>Signiferi,</hi> or Enſigns, whoſe imployment was to attend their Colours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> after all his Victories, doubled the wages of the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers<note place="margin">

A Legion was not always of a like ſtrength, for ſometimes it conſiſted of three thouſand, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times four thouſand, or four thouſand two hundred, ſometimes five thouſand, or five thouſand two hundred; and twice I find it was of ſix thouſand, or ſix thouſand two hundred, once with <hi>Scipio</hi> in <hi>Africk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and the ſecond time with <hi>Aemilius</hi> in the <hi>Macedonian</hi> War.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> that famous Hiſtorian, in his eighth Book giving a particular<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Livy</hi> his vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> account of the great Battel fought between the <hi>Romans,</hi> and their old Allies the <hi>Latines,</hi> marſhals the <hi>Roman</hi> Legion in ſuch a confuſed way, that he is not at all intelligible; and hath given juſt reaſon to both Learned and Military men, to think that place is corrupt, and a ſenſe made of it, never intended by the Author. To avoid prolixity, and that I be not at the trouble to give you <hi>Livy</hi>'s words, firſt in <hi>Latine</hi> and then in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I ſhall give you the ſtory as it is tranſlated by <hi>Philemon Holland,</hi> (except where he miſtakes) and then ſhew the errours of that deſcription of a Legion.</p>
                  <p>In former times, ſaith <hi>Livy,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Batallions ſtood thick, and cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether like the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Phalanx, but afterwards they were ranged into Bands more diſtinctly, and laſt of all they were divided into thinner Squadrons, each of them containing threeſcore Souldiers, two Centurions, and one Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſign.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97406:53"/> The Van-guard were <hi>Haſtati,</hi> Javelineers, in fifteen Maniples diſtant a little way from one another; ſuch a Squadron had twenty light armed, who carried a light Javeline, and ſome Darts to caſt afar; all the reſt were Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geteers. This firſt front contained the flower of the youth, who grew up as Apprentices in War-ſervice. Then follow'd after them of men of ſtronger and riper years as many Maniples, and theſe were called <hi>Principes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Theſe were follow'd (not hard at heels, as the Tranſlator adds) by all the Targe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers in gallant Armour. That Batallion of thirty Maniples was called <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilani,</hi> becauſe the other fifteen Orders were placed under the Enſigns (not hard before them, as <hi>Philemon</hi> very viciouſly tranſlates it) and of theſe, every Order conſiſted of three parts, and every one of them was called <hi>Primum Pilum:</hi> It conſiſted of three Enſigns, and every one of theſe had one hundred eighty ſix men. The firſt Colours had with it the <hi>Triarii,</hi> old Souldiers, and of approved valour: The ſecond had the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus far <hi>Livius,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who put him in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And indeed we have enough, and too much of this ſtuff. Let us now obſerve the errors of this diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is queſtionable, if ever the <hi>Romans</hi> uſed the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Phalange,<note place="margin">The errors of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t.</note> a Body compos'd purely of Pike-men; it is ſpoke of by none: and that this great Body in after times was caſt in Maniples, to me is fabulous; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Maniples were uſed by <hi>Romulus;</hi> and though this were true, we muſt not for all that grant, that every Maniple had but ſixty men (that being only true of the <hi>Triarii</hi>) or if that were granted too, ſure we will not acknowledge that every band of ſixty (except ſtill the <hi>Triarii</hi>) had two Centurions, and one Enſign. Secondly, That every Claſs of the <hi>Haſtati, Principes</hi> and <hi>Triarii,</hi> had fiftten Maniples, is againſt all Antiquity, and the current of moſt, if not all Authors, who allow no more Maniples to a Legion but thirty, nor Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiates but threeſcore, except <hi>Vegetius,</hi> who reduceth the number of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies to fifty five. Now <hi>Livy</hi>'s deſcription of a Legion makes it contain forty five Maniples, and ninety Centuriates, and all this is point blank againſt himſelf in other places. Thirdly, We are told<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that each of the fifteen laſt Orders was divided into three parts, and every part was called <hi>Primum Pilum.</hi> Is there any thing more ridiculous, than to call that firſt, which was but ſecond or third? And if theſe forty five parts (for ſo many, if multiplied by three, it extends to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) be all firſt, which of the forty five ſhall be laſt? Fourthly, Every one of theſe parts had its Colours; and ſo in the third Claſs there were forty five Enſigns, and but fifteen in each of the other two, a thing nothing probable. Fifthly, Every one of theſe Enſigns had one hundred eighty ſix men. Aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is ſo extravagant, that it cannot plead for any ſhew of truth; for mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply one hundred eighty ſix by forty five, the product will be eight thouſand three hundred and ſeventy; and ſo ſtrong by this account, muſt the <hi>Triarii</hi> have been, joyn'd with the <hi>Rorarii</hi> and <hi>Accenſi;</hi> a thing ſo notoriouſly and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably falſe, that it deſerves no refutation.</p>
                  <p>This paſſage of <hi>Titus Livius</hi> hath been, no doubt, obſerv'd by many of his<note place="margin">All occaſion'd by the firſt Printers.</note> Readers, long before <hi>Juſtus Lipſius</hi> was born; yet for any thing I know, he is the firſt man that offer'd him help; and indeed he hath done gallantly, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate ſo renowned an Author from theſe injuries the firſt Printers of his Decads have done him: For <hi>Lipſius</hi> ſaith, that aſſuredly this rhapſody of nonſence proceeded from the little underſtanding they had of the true Text. And <hi>Steuechius</hi> on another ſubject ſays, that Printers in the printing old Manuſcripts have committed ſuch groſs faults, that he knows not whether that admirable Art of Printing hath done more hurt or good to the Common-wealth of Learning. But to our purpoſe.</p>

Fourthly, Where you find it written, <hi>Earum unamquam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que (ſcilicet partem) primum pilum vocabant: Lipſius</hi> deſires you to read, <hi>Earum unamquamque primam, primum pilum vocabant. Lipſius</hi> tells us all this by piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, as I have told it you; <hi>Terduzzi</hi> ſumms it up together in <hi>Latine,</hi> and then tranſlates it into his <hi>Italian</hi> language. I ſhall give it you in <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus: Every <hi>Ordo</hi> (that is Centuriate) had ſixty two Souldiers, one Centurion, and one Colours: The firſt <hi>Acies</hi> or Batallion was of <hi>Haſtati,</hi> in it were ten Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niples, diſtant a little one from another; theſe were the flower of the youth: As many Maniples of a more robuſt age follow'd, who were called <hi>Principes:</hi> Thoſe who follow'd them were all Targeteers, in brave Armour. That Body of twenty Maniples was called <hi>Antepilani,</hi> becauſe under the Enſigns other ten were placed in order, every firſt whereof was called <hi>Primum Pilum.</hi> Aſſuredly <hi>Lipſius</hi> hath very rationally corrected this corrupted place of <hi>Livy,</hi> and hath render'd it obvious to ſenſe; whereas before it was totally unintelligible: And I wiſh that this place of <hi>Lipſius</hi>'s amendment, were always inſerted when <hi>Livy</hi> is Reprinted.</p>
                  <p>But I wiſh alſo, that <hi>Lipſius</hi> had mended another eſcape, which immediately<note place="margin">But not all.</note> follows; for in that ſame corrupted place of <hi>Livius,</hi> we read that every <hi>ordo Triariorum tribus ex vexillis conſtabat;</hi> that is, Every Maniple of them had three Enſigns; this impreſſion <hi>Lipſius</hi> retains, and that brings him to the neceſſity<note place="margin">And errs himſelf.</note> (whereof I told you in my Diſcourſe of the Infantry) to ſay, that Enſigns or Banners might be without Captains or Leaders; the matter ſtands thus: <hi>Livi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in this Battel marſhals the <hi>Rorarii</hi> behind the <hi>Triarii,</hi> and the <hi>Accenſi</hi> behind them: Which at that time was politickly done by the Conſul <hi>Manlius;</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to do with the <hi>Latines,</hi> who were perfectly well acquainted with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Roman</hi> Embattelling, and who marſhall'd their Army in that ſame faſhion; he put thoſe raw blades of the <hi>Rorarii</hi> and <hi>Accenſi</hi> behind his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented <hi>Triarii;</hi> and when the <hi>Latines</hi> prevail'd over the <hi>Roman Haſtati</hi> and <hi>Principes,</hi> the Conſul ſubtilly cauſed the <hi>Rorarii</hi> and <hi>Accenſi</hi> to ariſe, whom the <hi>Latines</hi> conceiving to be the <hi>Roman Triarii,</hi> cauſed their <hi>Triarii</hi> to come to the ſhock with theſe <hi>Rorarii,</hi> and after ſome fight put them to flight; then did <hi>Manlius</hi> advance with the true and freſh <hi>Roman Triarii,</hi> who eaſily overthrew the weary, and ſomething diſorder'd <hi>Latines,</hi> over whom he gain'd a glorious Victory. Now obſerve, that the <hi>Rorarii</hi> and <hi>Accenſi</hi> were <hi>Velites,</hi> and ſo had neither Officer nor Colours; and that every Maniple of the <hi>Triarii</hi> had two Centurions, and two Enſigns; call them <hi>Signa</hi> or <hi>Vexilla,</hi> as you will: And therefore I admire, neither can I wonder enough, why <hi>Lipſius</hi> for <hi>ex tribus Vexillis,</hi> will not deſire us to read <hi>ex <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The reaſon he gives for his judgement is, I think, exceedingly weak: Becauſe, ſaith he, <hi>Livy</hi> in that ſame eighth Book of his Hiſtory confeſſeth that ten years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that War, the Legion was no ſtronger but four thouſand Foot. An ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence: For it might very well be true, that ten years before, the Legion was but four thouſand, and yet it might have been thought very fitting to add one thouſand to them in the time of that dangerous War with the <hi>Latines.</hi> The year before <hi>Scipio</hi> carried the War out of <hi>Italy</hi> over to <hi>Africk,</hi> the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were but five thouſand apiece, yet he made ſome of them ſix thouſand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The year before <hi>Lucius Aemilius</hi> went to <hi>Macedon,</hi> the Legions were but five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, yet in that expedition of his, they were made up to ſix thouſand. If one year brought forth ſuch alterations, ten years might have produced greater.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of a Legion, Marſhall'd according to <hi>Vegetius.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I May with much reaſon, deſire that from my Reader, which <hi>Vegetius</hi> deſires from his; and that is, that what is writ by him on this ſubject, may be attentively read, and read over again; becauſe, ſaith he, the deſcription I am to give is difficult and obſcure. Indeed, what others who have peruſed him have found, I know not; but I am ſure I find his deſcription of a Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both difficult and obſcure, as he hath made it. This he Prefaceth in the fourth Chapter of his ſecond Book, and in the ſixth Chapter of that ſame Book he gives us the ordering of a Legion, and the Marſhalling it, in this manner:</p>
                  <p>You muſt know, ſaith he, that in every Legion there are ten Cohorts,<note place="margin">The firſt Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallion of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getius</hi> his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> but the firſt excells the reſt both in number and dignity: It conſiſts of the choice men, and with it is the Eagle, which is the prime Banner in every Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. This Cohort hath in it one thouſand one hundred and five Souldiers of Foot, and one hundred thirty two heavy armed Horſe-men: It is called the Milliary or Millenary Cohort, and is the head of the Legion; for from it, when they are to fight, the reſt of the firſt Batallion is marſhall'd. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cohort conſiſts of five hundred fifty five Foot, and ſixty ſix Horſe, and is called the Cohort of five hundred. The third Cohort hath the like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Horſe and Foot, but in it, ſaith he, there muſt be the ableſt men, becauſe it ſtands in the middle of the Batallion. The fourth Cohort hath five hundred fifty five foot and ſixty ſix Horſe. The fifth hath juſt as many, but it hath need, ſays he, to be compoſed of very ſtout Souldiers, becauſe, as the firſt Cohort is to ſtand on the Right Wing of the Batallion, ſo the fifth is to ſtand on the Left hand. Theſe five Cohorts make up the firſt <hi>Acies,</hi> or Batallion. Our Author proceeds, and tells us, The ſixth Cohort<note place="margin">The ſecond Batallion.</note> conſiſts of five hundred fifty five Foot, and ſixty ſix Horſe; in it muſt be thoſe of the younger years (he means the <hi>Haſtati</hi>) becauſe the ſixth Cohort hath its ſtation behind the Eagle, and the Enſigns. The ſeventh Cohort hath in it five hundred fifty five Foot, and ſixty ſix Horſe. The eighth hath as many, but they muſt be couragious men, becauſe they keep the middle of the ſecond Batallion. The ninth conſiſts of five hundred fifty five Foot, and ſixty Horſe: And ſo doth the tenth, but the Souldiers muſt be good War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, becauſe they ſtand on the Left hand of the ſecond Batallion. Now you ſee the firſt Batallion conſiſts of three thouſand three hundred twenty five Foot, and three hundred ninety ſix Horſe. And the ſecond Batallion of two thouſand ſeven hundred ſeventy five Foot, and three hundred and thirty Horſe: Add theſe together, the aggregate will be ſix thouſand one hundred Foot, and ſeven hundred twenty ſix Horſe. And ſo the Legion is compleatly divided into theſe two Batallions, without Reſerve for a third Body; which, I pray you obſerve. And he avers there ſhould not be a leſſer number (mark it) of armed men in every Legion, a greater ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hath been. And for a Corollary to this diviſion of a Legion, he ſaith, in the eighth Chapter of that ſame Book, that there were in every Legion fifty five Centurions. If any man be not ſatisfied with what he hath ſaid already, he may read him in the fifteenth Chapter of that ſame Book, and there he ſhall be ſure to hear him ſpeak that ſame language, with very little difference.</p>
                  <p>Our Author ſays, By the example of one Legion he will declare how the<note place="margin">The ſame thing over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</note> Field ſhould be marſhall'd, when a Battel is to be fought. The Horſe, ſaith he, are to be plac'd in the Wings; let us remember this. The Body
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97406:55"/> of the Foot, ſaith he, begins to be order'd on the Right hand, where the firſt Cohort is plac'd: To this is joyn'n the ſecond Cohort; the third ſtands in the middle of the Batallion: To it joyns the fourth, and the fifth ſtands on the Left hand. All, ſays he, that fought in this firſt Batallion, were called <hi>Principes;</hi> and there he deſcribes their Offenſive and Defenſive Arms, needleſs here to be ſpoken of. The ſecond Battel, ſays he, was of the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> arm'd as the <hi>Principes.</hi> After theſe were the light armed, with <hi>Plumbatae,</hi> Swords, Bows and Arrows; Slingers there were likewiſe, who caſt Stones out of Slings, and Batton-ſlings; alſo Darters, who, he ſaith, ſhot Arrows out of Manubaliſts and Arcubaliſts. Thereafter he tells us, (forgetting what he ſaid but ſeven or eight lines before) that the ſecond Batallion (O Memory, where art thou) conſiſted of <hi>Haſtati:</hi> And, ſaith he, (not remembring he had told us the ſame words in the ſixth Chapter) In the ſecond Batallion, on the Right hand, was plac'd the ſixth Cohort; to which was joyn'd the ſeventh: The eighth kept the middle Battel, accompanied with the ninth; and the tenth Cohort kept conſtantly the Left hand of the ſecond Batallion: And ſo our Author ends that Chapter. Thus we have twice in two ſeveral Chapters the deſcription of a full Legion divided into ten Cohorts, and theſe ten marſhall'd in two Batallions or Claſſes of the <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Haſtati,</hi> without any mention<note place="margin">

                  <p>But in the ſixteenth Chapter of that ſame Book, as if ſome body had awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd him out of his dream, he ſays, after all theſe Batallions, the <hi>Triarii</hi> were placed, arm'd with Cataphracts, Head-pieces, Swords, Daggers (<hi>Semiſpathis</hi>) two Darts, and Lead-Bullets (Weapons given to that Claſs by none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.) Theſe <hi>Triarii,</hi> ſays he, kneeling on one knee reſted, till, the firſt Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel<note place="margin">At length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.</note> chancing to be beaten, they might renew the fight. If any man think he hath done well to remember the <hi>Triarii</hi> at laſt, who were the <hi>Romans</hi> greateſt ſtrength, I ſhall be content he enjoy his opinion, provided he let me keep mine; which is, that he needed not now have mention'd them at all, ſince he hath already marſhall'd his Legion; all the ten Cohorts of it, and all the full number of ſix thouſand one hundred Foot, compleatly without them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſhall tell you more in the next Chapter.</p>
                  <p>In the ſeventeenth Chapter of his ſecond Book he informs us, that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning<note place="margin">Velites.</note> of the fight the <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Haſtati</hi> ſtood ſtill, and mov'd not; and the <hi>Triarii</hi> kneel'd or ſate (for he ſpeaks of both poſtures) till the light arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had skirmiſhed, and were beat in to the Legionaries; and after the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the heavy arm'd kept their ground, and ſtood like a Wall, leaving the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the routed Enemy to the Horſe, and the <hi>Velites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I cannot find in my heart to part with <hi>Vegetius,</hi> till I ſee how he will<note place="margin">Legion once more mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall'd.</note> yet be pleaſed to diſpoſe of the <hi>Triarii:</hi> And I find him in the fourteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his third Book begin <hi>de novo</hi> to marſhal the Foot, as if he had never ſpoke one word of it before. It is, ſaith he, the Law of embattelling, to place the old and experienced Souldiers in the firſt order (here he confounds <hi>Ordo</hi> and <hi>Acies</hi>) and theſe were called <hi>Principes.</hi> In the ſecond were the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> and then he ſpeaks of Diſtances between the Orders, whereof I ſhall tell you in my diſcourſe of Intervals. The third Order or Body was of the ſwifteſt <hi>Velites,</hi> as Darters, and the youngeſt Archers. The fourth was of the youngeſt Archers, (Good Lord, again youngeſt Archers) and theſe, ſaith he, who<note place="margin">Strange repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions.</note> were called Lanciers, and were alſo called <hi>Martiobarboli,</hi> and were Lead-ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: If theſe beat the Enemy, ſaith he, they purſued him too; but if they were beaten, they were receiv'd by the firſt and ſecond Batallion; ſuppoſe of heavy armed: You ſee how <hi>Vegetius</hi> loves to refreſh his Readers memory. Well then, the third and fourth Batallions fought before the firſt and ſecond, or any of them came to the ſhock. In the fifth Batallion our Author places Carrobaliſts, Slingers and Batton-Slingers. But I muſt propoſe a queſtion or two by the way. Firſt, Did the third and fourth Batallions, both which, as you ſee,<note place="margin">Two queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> he makes to conſiſt of the <hi>Velites,</hi> after they had fought with, and were repelled by an Enemy, retire only to the Rear of the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> or to the Rear of the Army? I ſuppoſe the laſt, though <hi>Vegetius</hi> through inadvertency, ſaith only to the Rear of the two firſt Batallions; for if ſo, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad undoubtedly obſtructed very much the advance of the <hi>Triarii,</hi> or the Retreat of both <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Haſtati;</hi> my
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97406:55"/> next Query is, why <hi>Vegetius</hi> doth not appoint the Slingers, and Batton ſlingers to skirmiſh in the Van, as well as the <hi>Velites</hi> of the third and fourth Batalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſince they were all light armed: and if it be ſaid the Slingers could caſt their ſtones over the heads of the two Batallions of heavy armed, I anſwer firſt, their ſtones would do leſs hurt at that diſtance. Secondly, the Archers in the third and fourth rank could have done as much. Thirdly, the keeping their ſtation and place in the fifth Batallion hinder'd the <hi>Triarii</hi> to advance. Now if theſe of <hi>Vegetius</hi> his third and fourth Batallions were obliged to go to the Van, and fight or skirmiſh there, why did he not appoint the light armed of his fifth Batallion to do ſo too, ſince they were all lyable to one Duty. But I hinder him to Marſhall his ſixth Batallion. The ſixth order or body, ſaith he, conſiſted of (and now welcome <hi>Triarii</hi>) Warriors furniſht with all manner of<note place="margin">Triarii.</note> Arms and Weapons, whom the Ancients called <hi>Triarii.</hi> Theſe, ſaith he, uſed to ſit (then they kneeled not) behind all the other Batallions, that being whole and ſound, and in breath, they might with more vigour attack the enemy; for if any thing fell out otherwiſe than well with the Batallions that ſtood before them, all hopes of recovery depended on them. Now if our Author hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken well of the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Legion, I am ſure he hath ſpoken enough of it. He hath been at much pains to make up that Legion, but that you may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſee the defects of it, I ſhall be at the trouble to take it down in pieces in the enſuing Chapter.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XII. Vegetius</hi> his Legion reviewed and examined.</head>
                  <p>WHoever hath read, or ſhall be pleaſed to read <hi>Vegetius</hi> his Treatiſe <hi>De re Militari,</hi> will believe with me, that he intended nothing leſs than to write the Military conſtitutions and cuſtoms of Levies, Arms, Exerciſing, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalling, Embattelling, Marching, or other Laws and Points of the Art of War uſed in his own days; but in the contrary, the <hi>Roman</hi> way and method of War of the ancient times. And this he profeſſeth all along, not only in his Prologues to his Maſter the Emperour <hi>Valentinian,</hi> but almoſt in every Book of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. In the Prologue of his ſecond Book, he ſays, the Emperour had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to ſet down the <hi>Antiqua,</hi> the ancient cuſtoms. In the Prologue to<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vegetius</hi> obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth himſelf to write of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Militia;</note> his third Book, he avers, that the Emperour had commanded him to abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate in one Piece all the ancient Military Cuſtoms and Conſtitutions which were diſperſed and ſcattered in ſeveral Books and Authors. And in one word he Entitles his Epitome, Inſtitutions of Military matters out of the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of <hi>Cato, Celſus, Trajan, Adrian,</hi> and <hi>Frontinus.</hi> Now, none of theſe wrote, or could write of any Military Cuſtoms practiſed in <hi>Vegetius</hi> his time, as having liv'd ſeveral ages before him, and he acknowledgeth himſelf that the Art of War of his days was but a ſhadow, and ſcarce that of the ancient one. But by the way I muſt tell you, that <hi>Steuechius</hi> thinks <hi>Adrian</hi> wrote no Military Conſtitutions, ſince at his deſire <hi>Aelian</hi> had compoſed that Piece <hi>de Inſtruendi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Aciebus,</hi> whereof we have ſpoken. But his reaſon is exceedingly weak, for <hi>Adrian</hi> might very well have written the <hi>Roman</hi> Military Art, and yet have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſired <hi>Aelian</hi> to write the <hi>Grecian</hi> one. But to return, <hi>Vegetius</hi> in the twentieth Chapter of his firſt Book having given us an account of the ancient <hi>Roman</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Not that of his own time.</note> Arms, acknowledgeth that they were wholly worn out, and that in compariſon of them, the Foot of his time were naked, which had given ſo great an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Barbarous Nations of the <hi>Goths, Huns</hi> and <hi>Allans.</hi> To the Eighth Chapter of his ſecond Book, he gives this title, <hi>Of thoſe who were leaders of the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97406:56"/> ancient Centuries and Files.</hi> And the Seventh Chapter of that Book he begins with theſe words, Having expounded, ſaith he, the ancient ordering of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And in many other places he witneſſeth, that it is the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, that he is to open to us, and no new one which had deviated from that old one.</p>
                  <p>This being premiſed by me to anticipate objections, I make bold to charge <hi>Vegetius</hi> with ſeven groſs Errours in the deſcription of his Legion, yet all ſeven<note place="margin">Seven Errors in the Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Legion.</note> will not amount to one mortal ſin, (which, they ſay, be likewiſe ſeven) nay, nor to one capital crime. But if he be guilty of all theſe, or any of theſe, then I ſay, he is not ſo good as his word in the fourth Chapter of his Second Book, where he promiſeth <hi>Ordinationem Legionis antiquae, ſecundum norman Militaris Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris exponore:</hi> To expound to us the right ordering of an ancient Legion according to the Rule of Military Law. But I ſhall endeavour to juſtifie my charge in this following order.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I queſtion the number of his Legionary Foot, which he makes to be<note place="margin">Firſt Error.</note> ſix thouſand one hundred, and all heavy armed; mark that I read once of ſix thouſand, and once more of ſix thouſand and two hundred, (and in that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were comprehended the <hi>Velites</hi>) but never of ſix thouſand and one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hundred. The truth is, <hi>Romulus</hi> made his Legion three thouſand, after him it was augmented and diminiſhed according to the King, Senate, or peoples plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or the neceſſities of the State to 4000, to 4200, to 5000, to 5200, and ſometimes (but very ſeldom) to 6000, or 6200, as Regiments are now made ſtronger and weaker in our modern Levies, according to the pleaſure of the Prince or State who makes them; but for moſt part the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Legion was 4000, or 4200. <hi>Livy</hi> in his Sixth Book ſays, four Legions were levied againſt the <hi>Gauls,</hi> each of 4000 Foot. In his Seventh Book, he ſays, that in the Conſulſhip of young <hi>Camillus,</hi> four Legions were raiſed, each of 4200 Foot. In his Eighth Book he tells us, that in the War againſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> every Legion conſiſted of 5000 Foot. In his Ninth Book he makes the Legion to be 4000 Foot, in the War againſt the <hi>Samnites.</hi> In his 21 Book he ſpeaks of ſix Legions, each of them 4000 Foot. And not to ſpend more time in Inſtances, the ſame Hiſtorian (out of whom and <hi>Polybius,</hi> I ſuppoſe <hi>Vegetius</hi> borrowed his greateſt light of Hiſtory) ſays in his 22 Book, that every <hi>Roman</hi> Legion was 5000 Foot in the time of their dangerous War with their redoubted enemy <hi>Hannibal;</hi> but after that was ended, they were reduced to 4000 till the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi> War, except that ſome of them were made 6200 by <hi>Scipio.</hi> Unleſs then once in <hi>Africk,</hi> and once in <hi>Greece,</hi> we never find a Legion 6000 ſtrong, but never at all to be 6100, as <hi>Vegetius</hi> would have it to be conſtantly. He would have done himſelf much right, and his Reader a great favour to have told who levied theſe Legions of 6100. if it was ſo in his own time, or yet in the deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of both the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire and Militia, that makes, nothing to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it is the ancient cuſtoms we require of him, for it is theſe he promiſed to us. But if we take in all theſe three Bodies of light armed Foot which he ſo frequently mentions in the number of the Legion, as <hi>Rolybius</hi> doth the <hi>Velites</hi> in his Legion, and proportion 400 light arm'd for every 1000 heavy arm'd, as the ſame <hi>Polybius</hi> doth; then <hi>Vegetius</hi> his Legion ſhall exceed 8500, of which we read in no ſtory. Now if all theſe Inſtances I have given out of <hi>Livius,</hi> and in another place ſhall give out of <hi>Polybius</hi> be true, then <hi>Vegetius</hi> his aſſertion, that a Legion ſhould have no fewer than 6100 heavy arm'd Foot, can have no truth at all in it, and that alſo which he ſubjoins in that ſame ſixth Chapter of his Second Book muſt be falſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I cannot believe him that either every Troop conſiſted of 32 Horſe,<note place="margin">Second Error.</note> or that 726 Riders belong'd to every Legion. If I truſt either the one or the other, I muſt give the lye to two more ancient Writers than himſelf, that is <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Livius.</hi> The laſt whereof in his Seventh Book ſaith, four Legions were elected, and for every one of them 300 Horſe. In the dangerous War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Hannibal,</hi> no more but 300 Horſe for a Legion. <hi>Livy</hi> in his Ninth Book ſpeaks but of 300 Horſe for every Legion in the War with the <hi>Samnites.</hi> In the great battel of <hi>Cannae</hi> they were but 300, as that Hiſtorian witneſſeth in his 22 Book. In his 29 Book he ſaith, <hi>Scipio</hi> had no more in <hi>Africk</hi> but 300 Horſe for every Legion, the Foot whereof were 6200. And his brother <hi>Lucius Scipio</hi>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:97406:56"/> had no more in <hi>Aſia</hi> but 300 for every Legion of 5400 Foot. Neither had the Conſul <hi>Aemilius</hi> more Horſe for a Legion in <hi>Macedon</hi> than 300, though the Foot were 6000. Once I read in <hi>Livy,</hi> it is in his 40 Book, and if I remember right, it was againſt the <hi>Ligurians,</hi> that 400 Horſe were ordained for each Legion; otherwiſe according to <hi>Livius,</hi> the number was conſtantly 300. <hi>Polybius</hi> all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in his Hiſtory allots no more Horſe to a Legion but 300, except once, (and I pray you obſerve it) it is in his Second Book, where he ſaith, the Senate ſent two Legions to <hi>Sicily,</hi> each conſiſting of 4000 Foot, and 200 Horſe; and as this is the leaſt number I read of, ſo that of <hi>Livy</hi>'s 400 Horſe againſt the <hi>Ligurians</hi> is the greateſt number of Horſe for one Legion. In the Wars againſt both the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians, Polybius</hi> gives but 300 Horſe to every Legion. In the dividing his 726 Riders, <hi>Vegetius</hi> errs twice, firſt for allowing 22 Turms or Troops to the Cavalry, Ten being the ordinary number; next for allowing 32 Riders to each Troop, whereas there were but 30: Both which aſſertions of mine are grounded on Hiſtory, and are likewiſe taken out of <hi>Polybius</hi> his Sixth Book, as I have made it appear in my Diſcourſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry. Beſides, our Authors error in <hi>calculo</hi> may be charged on him as a <hi>Peccadillo,</hi> for though we ſhould admit 22 Troops in every Legion, and thirty two Riders in every Troop, the number will not amount to 726, for multiply 32 by 22, the aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate will be but 704. But in ſteps <hi>Steuechius,</hi> and lends <hi>Vegetius</hi> his hand, and ſays the Decurions muſt be added, who being 22 in number, (one for every Troop) makes <hi>Vegetius</hi> his number 726 compleat. But this ſhall not help him, for Decurions, Standard-bearers, Trumpeters, or Horn-winders, (if Troops had any of the laſt) were all of the number of the 30, and none of them Supernumeraries, as I have made it appear out of <hi>Polybius</hi> in my Diſcourſe of Cavalries, and therefore they muſt be of the number of the 32 likewiſe. And if I ſhould permit <hi>Steuechius</hi> to make the Decurions ſupernumeraries, he will be obliged to give me leave to reckon the Cornets and Trumpeters not to be of the number of the 32, and theſe being 44 in number would increaſe the horſe of every Legion to 770, and if he pleaſe he may reckon the <hi>Turmae, Coactores,</hi> or Bringers up, who by <hi>Polybius</hi> his account were three for every Turme, and conſequently 66 in 22 Troops, and then an addition being made of all, we ſhall find the aggregate of the Horſe for <hi>Vegetius</hi> his Legion to be 836.</p>
                  <p>The third complaint I make is that <hi>Vegetius</hi> Marſhals two Troops of Horſe<note place="margin">Third Error</note> with every Cohort and four Troops with the firſt Cohort. Obſerve that here it is not the queſtion whether this way of Marſhalling be good or not, nor is it the queſtion, whether it be not good, that Foot &amp; Horſe ſhould be near one another when they fight, but the queſtion is, whether the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> uſed this way, or not, or if this be the right way of ordering or Marſhalling an old Legion, which <hi>Vegetius</hi> promiſed to give us. I aver it is not; and I know no old Author will contradict my aſſertion. It will be loſt labour to inſtance theſe Battels de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by ancient Hiſtorians, who mention nothing like this manner of Embat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling. In my Diſcourſes of both Infantry and Cavalry, I have ſhown how Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have fought on foot, how they have fought with horſes unbridled; and how Foot and Horſe have been mingled together in Skirmiſhes, and Battels; but I read not in any Author of this method of Marſhalling, that <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſpeaks of; nay the current of Hiſtory evinceth the contrary for moſt part, the Horſe were drawn up in the wings, and the Foot in the Battel. So it was at <hi>Cannae,</hi> where the Conſul <hi>Aemilius</hi> fought on the right hand with the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry, and <hi>Terentius Varo</hi> on the left with the Horſe of the Allies. The like was done at the Battel of <hi>Metaurus</hi> againſt <hi>Aſdrubal.</hi> In the two Battels which <hi>Scipio</hi> fought in <hi>Africk,</hi> the very ſame was practiſed. Sometimes all the Horſe were Marſhalled in one of the wings as <hi>Caeſar</hi> drew up all his in the right wing of the army; and <hi>Pompey</hi> moſt of his Cavalry on the left hand of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at that great Battel of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> where theſe two brave <hi>Romans</hi> fought for no leſs wager than the Empire of the World. At <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zita</hi> the ſame <hi>Caeſar</hi> being to offer Battel to <hi>Scipio, Pompey</hi>'s Father-in-law, drew up all his Horſemen on the left-wing of his army, and mixed Foot with them. <hi>Polybius</hi> in his 14 Book in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us that the Great <hi>Scipio</hi> being to fight againſt <hi>Syphax,</hi> Marſhalled his <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe in one wing, and his Auxiliaries in the other. And which is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble againſt <hi>Vegetius,</hi> he ſays in that ſame place, that in doing ſo, <hi>Romana Militia
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97406:57"/> conſuetudinem ſimpliciter ſervavit.</hi> He ſimply and purely obſerved the cuſtom of the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia.</p>
                  <p>Nor will it be one full ſtep out of my way to tell you, that I think Horſe do not at all belong to a Legion, it being as I ſuppoſe wholly compoſed of Foot;<note place="margin">Horſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</note> for though moſt Hiſtorians tell us, that when Legions were levied, Horſe were alſo raiſed, and punctually for every Legion 300 Horſe, yet muſt not that be ſo underſtood as that theſe 300 horſe were to be reckoned to be a member or part of that Legion; nay, moſt Authors disjoin them, and ſay, ſo many Legions, and ſo many Horſe were raiſed. Let <hi>Caeſar</hi> an Author beyond all exception be Judg. In the Seventh Book of the <hi>French</hi> War, he ſays, he gave to his Legate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Labienus</hi> (the ſame who afterward deſerted him) four Legions, and kept ſix with himſelf; and that you may be ſure he meant only Foot, he ſubjoins that he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him to take a part of the Cavalry with him, how many he tells not; but if every Legion was to have a ſet number of horſes, that great Captain (who loſeth no words in his Commentaries) needed not have mentioned Horſe; for<note place="margin">Proved from <hi>Caeſar,</hi>

The <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes</hi> cry as loud, that <hi>Vegetius</hi> hath rob'd them of the dignity, they always had to ſtand in the middle between the <hi>Haſtati</hi> and the <hi>Triarii,</hi> and to be look'd on as the reſtorers of the Battel, when the <hi>Haſtati</hi> were worſted. But neither of them hath ſo good reaſon to complain as the <hi>Triarii,</hi> whom we ſhall hear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. And aſſuredly to me it ſeems very ſtrange, that not only in the mentioned places, but all along in his whole Treatiſe, our Author Marſhals the <hi>Principes</hi> before the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> againſt the univerſal conſent of all Hiſtory. <hi>Livy</hi> in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Book tells how <hi>Lenus</hi> the Conſul drew up his <hi>Haſtati</hi> in the Van, the <hi>Principes</hi> in the middle, and the <hi>Triarii</hi> in the Reer, againſt the <hi>Gauls;</hi> and then was the <hi>Roman</hi> Diſcipline ſtrictly obſerved. So were the <hi>Haſtati</hi> in the Van, when <hi>Marcellus</hi> fought at <hi>Canuſium</hi> with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> Liv. lib. 27. And in his 37 Book he informs us that <hi>Scipio Aſia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ſure the ſame <hi>Scipio</hi> at the battel of <hi>Zama</hi> againſt <hi>Hannibal,</hi> placed the <hi>Haſtati</hi> in the Van, by a good token; for they were ſo mixed with the enemy, that he was glad to found a Retreat for them, that he might have ground to bring his <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes</hi> up to the Medley, which the ſame <hi>Livy</hi> reports to us.</p>
                  <p>In the fifth place <hi>Polybius</hi> complains that <hi>Vegetius</hi> hath murther'd five of his<note place="margin">Fifth Error<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Truly it ſeems ſtrange to me that <hi>Polybius</hi> his Legion conſiſting but of 3000 heavy armed, ſhould have ſixty Centurions, and that of <hi>Vegetius,</hi> which was a hundred more than twice as ſtrong, ſhould have but 55, for all his 6100 were heavy arm'd, as he deſcribes them in that ſame Chapter. I can fancy no reaſon for this, but that it was his fancy to write ſo: I confeſs indeed it is more than probable that at the firſt inſtitution by <hi>Romulus,</hi> that band of men which was called a Century, conſiſted of one hundred men; and ſo the Centurions were no more but thirty, and in proceſs of time in a Legion of that ſame ſtrength might be ſixty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as I told you in my Diſcourſe of the Infanteries, though the particular bands of a Legion came to conſiſt but of ſixty men, and thoſe of the <hi>Triarii</hi> perhaps but of thirty men, yet ſtill the denominations of Century and Centurio remained as before. But never was a Centurio heard of that commanded more men than one hundred, except in <hi>Vegetius</hi> his Legion, in the firſt Cohort whereof (conſiſting of 110<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> men) every Centurion commanded 184 men; if there were but ſix Centuriats in that Cohort, as is to be ſuppoſed; for if you divide 1105 by ſix, the Quotient will be 184 with the fraction of, one; but till <hi>Vegetius</hi> his number of 55 Centurions be made more clear to us, than yet it is, we may ſafely believe with <hi>Polybius,</hi> that in one Legion though not ſo ſtrong as that of <hi>Vegetius,</hi> there were no fewer than ſixty Centurions, to which <hi>Titus Livius</hi> doth give his conſent in his Eighth Book, as the place is amended and corrected by <hi>Lipſius,</hi> according to the true and genuine ſenſe of the Author.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, to my ſenſe it is undeniable, ſince the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia was reformed,<note place="margin">Sixth Error<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> and indeed almoſt inſtituted by <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius,</hi> that there were ten Cohorts in every Legion, even when it conſiſted but of 3000; three Centuries at that time making a Cohort, and afterwards three Maniples, every one whereof was compoſed of two Centuriats. If the Centuries conſiſted of full hundreds, then each Maniple contained two hundred, and conſequently the Cohort conſiſted of ſix hundred. And ſo we may ſuppoſe <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Aemilius</hi> their Cohorts to have been, when their Legions were ſix thouſand a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

But a Cohort of 1105 men, as <hi>Vegetius</hi> will have his firſt Cohort to be, is not to paſs muſter, and as little warrant he had to make every one of his other nine Cohorts to conſiſt of 555 heavy armed. Sure he might with more eaſe to himſelf have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to his right-hand Cohort 700 men, and to every one of the other nine, 600; and this had compleated his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Or if he had made his Legion compleatly 6000 and no more, he might have given equally to every Centurion of ſixty, one hundred men, and this had been the faireſt and impartialeſt dealing. But how the whimſie of his fractions of fives
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:97406:58"/> flew in his head I cannot tell, unleſs to trouble both himſelf and his Reader.</p>
                  <p>But ſeventhly, Room, room, cry the <hi>Triarii,</hi> they can have no longer pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<note place="margin">Seventh Error.</note> either to kneel or ſit, they are all on foot, <hi>Conclamant arma,</hi> they expect neither <hi>Principes,</hi> nor <hi>Haſtati</hi> to retire to them, but advance in full arms, threatning they will be members of the Legion, and the principal members too; and in the Legion they will be, though it were over <hi>Vegetius</hi> his belly. They are very angry that in the ſixth and 15 Chapters of his Second Book, he ſhould have muſter'd a compleat Legion without them, their clamour is ſo loud, that to pacifie them, <hi>Vegetius</hi> in the 14 Chapter of his Third Book, aſſigns them place behind three bodies of light armed, and ordains them to be the ſixth Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallion, and to give them ſome eaſe after the wrong he had done them, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them to ſit, whereas before he had order'd them to kneel, ſometimes on one, ſometimes on both knees. But indeed they have no reaſon to be ſatisfied with ſuch favours, ſince he hath wholly exterminated them out of the Legion, in both his deſcriptions of it; for he divides the whole Legion, and all the ten Cohorts of it, and every man of theſe ten Cohorts into two <hi>Acies,</hi> or Batalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; in the firſt whereof he placeth the <hi>Principes</hi> conſiſting of five Cohorts, in which are 3325 men. In the ſecond he rangeth the <hi>Haſtati</hi> in five Cohorts, in which he muſters 2775 men, which make compleatly up his full number of 6100 heavy armed. So you ſee in both theſe places there is no room left, nor mention made of the <hi>Triarii.</hi> And though in his Third Book he appoints them to be in the Reer, yet the Legion being made up of the <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Haſtati</hi> without them, it muſt follow that in <hi>Vegetius</hi> his account the <hi>Triarii</hi> were no Legionaries. Beſides all this, they accuſe him of either theft or robbery, becauſe in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>6th</hi> Chapter of his Second Book, he hath either ſtoln or violently taken from them the <hi>Eagle,</hi> and given it to the firſt Cohort of the <hi>Principes;</hi> for they aver that it, being the prime Enſign of the Legion, was recommended to their care, and the keeping of it to their <hi>Primipilus,</hi> or firſt Centurion. How <hi>Vegetius</hi> will anſwer to all theſe accuſations, I know not, but thoſe who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him had beſt do it out of his own Books; for I have conſulted his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator <hi>Steuechius,</hi> and find he pleads nothing at all for him, nay, nor ſeems not to take notice, that he ſtands in need of his help, for Commenting on that ſame Chapter I laſt ſpoke of: all he tells us is that there was but one <hi>Eagle</hi> in a<note place="margin">

And indeed to tell it once for all, <hi>Steuechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> is large and prolix enough to explain things where no difficulty appears, but where matters are debatable, I find in him nothing but a profound ſilence.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not need to tell my Reader how <hi>Vegetius</hi> repeats things over and over<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vegetius</hi> his Tautalogies.</note> again, nor how his Tautologies are obvious, <hi>

But I dare preſume to ſay that if any of the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Dictators or Conſuls, who Triumphed gloriouſly over their enemies, had liv'd in the Emperour <hi>Valentinians</hi> time, they would rather have chuſed to have ſubmitted the fortune of their battels to the doubtful Die of War once more, than to have Marſhall'd their Legions after <hi>Vegetius</hi> his Model.</p>

There were ſome reaſons why <hi>Scipio</hi> ſhould be kind to <hi>Polybius,</hi> becauſe his Natural Father <hi>Lucius Aemilius,</hi> (for this <hi>Scipio</hi> was but the adopted Grand-child of the great <hi>Africanus</hi>) was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of carrying many hundred <hi>Achaeans</hi> Priſoners to <hi>Rome,</hi> (for no reaſon but ſuſpicion) among whom <hi>Polybius</hi> was one, who lay full ſeventeen years Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner there, where he had leiſure enough to learn both the <hi>Roman</hi> language and cuſtomes. <hi>Scipio</hi> was a very great Captain, a ſtrict reformer of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Militia, and a ſevere Diſciplinarian, from whom <hi>Polybius</hi> could not but know all the myſteries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Art of War, being a perſon of ſo great abilities, as thoſe parcels of his Hiſtory, yet extant, ſpeak him ta have been; and truly we have reaſon to be ſorry that we are robb'd of thoſe Books of his, of which all-devouring time hath deprived us. Let us hear how he marſhals a <hi>Roman</hi> Legion.</p>
                  <p>A Legion in that <hi>Scipio Minor</hi>'s time, conſiſted of four thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, as many times it did both before and after him; whereof ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred were <hi>Triarii,</hi> and made the third Batallion, obliged to kneel on their Right knee, till either the other two Claſſes retir'd to them, or that the General com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to riſe and advance. Theſe, he ſaith, were never more than ſix hundred, though the Legion chanc'd to be four thouſand two hundred, as many times it did. And for this we muſt take his word. Before the <hi>Triarii</hi> ſtood the <hi>Principes,</hi> men in the flower of their age; and before them, the <hi>Haſtati</hi> in the Van; they were the youngeſt and raweſt of all the heavy arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; each of theſe two Batallions conſiſted of twelve hundred; and all the three were alike arm'd, except that the <hi>Triarii,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Pila,</hi> carry'd ſhort Spears; of all which I have ſpoken ſufficiently already.

He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points his Legion to be divided into thirty Maniples (ſuppoſe ſtill the heavy armed) each Maniple to conſiſt of two Centuriates; to every Century he allows an Enſign and a Centurion, whom he permits to chuſe his Sub-Centurion;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97406:59"/> of all which I have already ſpoke. The numbers of the <hi>Haſtati, Principes,</hi> and <hi>Velites,</hi> might alter, according to the ſtrength of the Legion, but not the <hi>Triarii.</hi> He tells us, that three hundred Horſe were levied with every Legion; but ſays not, that they made a part of every Legion. Theſe three hundred Horſe he divides into ten Turms or Troops, and Officers them, as I have ſhown you in my Diſcourſe of the Cavalry. He leaves them to be marſhall'd, where the Commander in chief thought they might do beſt ſervice. And now we have the <hi>Polybian</hi> Legion.</p>

                  <p>BEfore we proceed to our conjectures, it will be fit, firſt to know what this word <hi>Interval</hi> properly ſignifies, and how it is taken.

Theſe Stakes were, and are of two kinds, longer and ſhorter; the firſt ſtood ſtraight up from the ground, the ſecond had the one end of them fixed in the Rampart, and the other lying on it, to hinder an approach to it; diſtinguiſhed by the <hi>Germans</hi> by ſeveral names, for they call the long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Stakes Palli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Ground, Earth, or part of the Rampart, between two Palliſadoes or Stocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, is properly called an Interval; but it is borrow'd, and appropriated to<note place="margin">Interval what.</note> any diſtance between Bodies greater and ſmaller; yea, to the ſpace that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one time and another, an Interval of time is now language proper enough, and Phyſicians borrow it, and call an Intermitting Ague, <hi>Febris Intervallata,</hi> an Intervalled Feavor.</p>
                  <p>What diſtance or Intervals there were between <hi>Roman</hi> Ranks, and between<note place="margin">Deepneſs of the File not told</note> Files between ſeveral Bodies of either their Horſe or Foot, no ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath clear'd to us, but left us to grope in the dark. Nor can we well gueſs at them, till we condeſcend how many in File both Horſe and Foot were marſhall'd. I told you before, that <hi>Vegetius</hi> in the twenty fifth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">By <hi>Vegetius.</hi>
                     </note> of his ſecond Book, ſeems to make the Foot eleven deep, becauſe, as I told you, he orders a <hi>Contubernium</hi> of Souldiers to manage a Carrobaliſt, and that, he ſaith, conſiſted of eleven men. But this doth not prove that <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getius</hi> his File was preciſely eleven, no more than what he ſaith in the fifteenth Chapter of his third Book (that ten thouſand men drawn up in ſix Ranks, will take up ſo much ground in Front) will prove, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Foot were drawn up ſix deep. And ſo for <hi>Vegetius,</hi> we know not the deepneſs of either the <hi>Roman</hi> Foot or Horſe. Nor will we be one jot the wiſer for <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius</hi>

But this ſuppoſition, as probable, we muſt make the baſis or ground, on which to build our moſt probable conjectures of the Intervals of ſeveral Bodies and Claſſes, in which both our Authors give us ſmall aſſiſtance, yet I ſhall give you all I can pick out of them, or others, on that Subject.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Polybius</hi> in his twelfth Book told us, that for moſt part Horſe-men were ranged eight deep (meaning, I think, the <hi>Perſian</hi> Horſe) he ſubjoins, that there muſt be an Interval between ſeveral Troops; but what that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val was, he forgot to tell us: It is pity, he who knew things ſo well, ſhould needleſsly have kept them up from us as ſecrets; the reaſon he gives for an Interval between two Troops doth not weigh much, becauſe, ſaith he, they<note place="margin">Intervals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Troops</note> muſt have ground for converſion; that is, to face to either Right or Left hand, or by any of them to the Rear. If any of theſe be needful, whole Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons of four, ſix or eight Troops joyn'd together, may do it as eaſily and conveniently as ſingle Troops, which conſiſt of three or four Files at moſt. But converſions on that ſame ground are ſeldome neceſſary, never conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. But being left to gueſs, how many foot of Interval, Troops ten deep<note place="margin">Conjectured</note> required one from another, I conjecture, eight Foot; which I ground on that, the ſame <hi>Polybius</hi> ſaith in that ſame twelfth Book, which is, that a <hi>Stadium,</hi> or Furlong, contain'd eight hundred Horſe drawn up in Battel. Then I ſay, Firſt, a <hi>Stadium,</hi> is the eighth part of an <hi>Italian</hi> mile, one hundred twenty five paces, ſix hundred twenty five Foot. Secondly, eight hundred Horſe, being at our Authors rate eight in File, are one hundred in Front. Thirdly, For every Horſe-man to ſtand on Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> back, and room to handle his Arms; I allow, with others, four foot of ground, and ſo for one hundred Horſes, four hundred Foot. Fourthly, According to <hi>Polybius,</hi> and, I ſuppoſe, the<note place="margin">Out of <hi>Polybi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Roman</hi> rule, the eight hundred Horſe muſt be divided into ſeveral Troops, and in each of them but thirty Riders; ſo there will be twenty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>x compleat Troops, and twenty Horſe-men for the twenty ſeventh Troop. Fifthly, Twenty ſeven Troops require twenty ſix Intervals. Now allow with <hi>Polybi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> a <hi>Stadi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So my opinion is, (if I underſtand <hi>Polybius</hi> right) that the Interval between two ſingle Troops was about eight foot.</p>
                  <p>But let us fancy the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe to have been ten in File, and ſo every Troop only three in Front, for ſo I probably think they were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and let u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> remember, that in every Conſular Army there were twenty <hi>Roman</hi> Troops, and forty of the Allies; in all ſixty. Fancy thoſe ſixty Troops drawn up in one Field, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one of the Wings of the Army (as ſeveral times all the Cavalry was marſhall'd on one Wing) they muſt have fifty nine Intervals. Next, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that ſixty Troops, at thirty in a Troop, were compos'd of eighteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred<note place="margin">Too many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals.</note> Riders; theſe drawn up, ten in File, made one hundred and eighty Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; allow to every one of theſe four foot, that will amount to ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty foot; then for fifty nine Intervals (which, according to <hi>Polybius,</hi> ſixty Troops muſt have) you are to allow four hundred ſeventy two foot (at eight foot for each Interval) I ſuppoſe ſtill that which I can ſcarcely believe, of ſo many Intervals; but add four hundred ſeventy two foot, to ſeven hundred
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:97406:60"/> and twenty, the aggregate will be eleven hundred ninety two foot. How theſe ſixty Troops, marſhall'd ſo thin, ſo few in Front, with ſo many Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, could ſtand out the brisk and furious charge of a numerous and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Enemy, is beyond my fancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unleſs they have been interlin'd with well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed Foot.</p>

But I ſhall not queſtion the ſix foot of diſtance between Files, being I have told you in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Militia that much was neceſſary for their Pike-men between Ranks on their march, though not between Files; and that in ſtanding in Battel, they uſed <hi>Denſatio,</hi> three foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of diſtance, and in fight, <hi>Conſtipa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

But that he allows none for them to ſtand on, when he ſpeaks of Files, I prove thus: In the fourteenth Chapter of his third Book, he allows three foot of diſtance between Files; and in the next place ſaith, that ten thouſand men, marſhall'd<note place="margin">The firſt in diſtance of Files.</note> ſix deep, made a Front of ſixteen hundred ſixty ſix: and ſo it doth with a fracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only of four; hitherto he is very right, but concludes very ill, that theſe ſixteen hundred ſixty ſix Files took no more ground up in Front but one thouſand paces, that is five thouſand foot. A thing purely impoſſible, for three foot of Diſtance is allowed by himſelf between File and File; and next, ſixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixty ſix Files require ſixteen hundred ſixty five diſtances; multiply ſixteen hundred ſixty five by three, the product is four thouſand nine hundred ninety five; theſe want but 5 foot of <hi>Vegetius</hi> his one thouſand paces. Where ſhall then the ſixteen hundred ſixty ſix Combatants ſtand, certainly they had ſixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixty ſix foot of ground to ſtand on; add ſixteen hundred ſixty ſix to four thouſand nine hundred ninety five, the aggregate is ſix thouſand ſix hundred ſixty one foot; a third more than <hi>Vegetius</hi> allow'd to ſixteen hundred ſixty ſix Files: In imitation of him, <hi>Terduzzi</hi> commits the very ſame errour in his fifth and ſixth Chapters.

But whether he meant Ranks or Batallions, the error I mention'd was ſtill the ſame, in making ſix ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bodies (be they Ranks, Files, Squadrons or Batallions) to have ſix diſtances, for they cannot poſſibly have more than five.

Next, concerning the Intervals between the Maniples of any of the three Claſſes (which the <hi>Romans</hi> call'd <hi>Via Directa</hi>) he ſaith, if the <hi>Velites</hi> were to ſtand in them, the Interval might be of twenty or thirty foot; if not, ten foot was enough. This is briefly all he ſays on the matter. But aſſuredly, if this learned man could convenlently have left the Univerſity of <hi>Louvaine,</hi> and followed the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armies but one Summer, or, as we call it, one Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne; he would have ſeen, under the conduct of the famous Dukes of <hi>Alva</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> (the greateſt Captains of that age) who liv'd at the time that he was writing his Books, how pitifully ſimple that School-ſpeculation of his was. I muſt confirm my opinion with Reaſon, for authority of Writers I have no more than he, and that is none at all.</p>
                  <p>Each of the two Claſſes of the <hi>Haſtati</hi> and <hi>Principes</hi> conſiſted of twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, which being marſhall'd ten deep, made one hundred and twenty Files; <hi>Vegetius</hi> allows three foot diſtance between Files, theſe make three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty foot in Front, add one hundred and twenty foot for the Files to ſtand on; the ground that either of theſe Batallions ſtood on, was four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighty foot in Longitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to ſhun debate, I ſhall be content to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low but one foot for every File to ſtand on, and two foot of Interval between Files, and ſo the Front of the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> (though they had been all marſhall'd in one Body, as they were in ſeveral Maniples) took up three hundred and ſixty foot. A leſs ſpace of ground cannot rationally be given for an Interval between them and the <hi>Principes,</hi> than the three hundred and ſixty foot they took up in Front; for when they either fled or retir'd to the ſecond Batallion, they muſt have had ſufficient ground to caſt themſelves in ſome good order, by Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to take up their places in the Intervals of the <hi>Principes.</hi> Now three hundred<note place="margin">Interval be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Haſtati</hi> and <hi>Principes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
                     </note> and ſixty foot is but ſeventy two paces, which certainly are ſoon traced by
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97406:61"/> men either flying or retiring haſtily. For to imagine that the <hi>Romans</hi> punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally kept Rank and File, when they were neceſſitated to a ſpeedy Retreat, is a vain ſpeculation. If this be allowed me, then it cannot be denied me, that the Interval between the <hi>Principes</hi> and the <hi>Triarii</hi> muſt have been twice as great, that is ſeven hundred and twenty Foot, becauſe the third Batallion was in time of need to receive both the other two. Here then were two great Intervals, one between the <hi>Haſtati</hi> and <hi>Principes,</hi> and the other between the <hi>Principes</hi> and the<note place="margin">Between <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Triarii.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Triarii,</hi> both of them called by the <hi>Romans, Via tranſverſa.</hi> This conjecture of mine may ſeem rational enough to thoſe who have obſerved in our modern Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the Intervals between the Brigades Marſhall'd in the Battel, and theſe of the reſerve, for leſs ground for them than what a Brigade takes up in front, is not uſually given.</p>
                  <p>But to ſupport my own opinion, and convince <hi>Lipſius</hi> of the vanity of his, I<note place="margin">Supported out of <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius;</hi>
                     </note> ſhall pick ſomething out of the 15 Book of <hi>Polybius,</hi> where he tells us that <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> marſhal'd his third Batallion more than one <hi>Stadium</hi> behind his ſecond one, and in doing ſo, ſays he, he followed the <hi>Roman</hi> cuſtom; obſerve this. Now a <hi>Stadium</hi> is ſix hundred and twenty five foot, and this wants but ninety five foot of my allowance of ſeven hundred and twenty for an Interval between the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes</hi> and the <hi>Triarii;</hi> and for that remember that he ſaid more than a <hi>Stadium,</hi> and you may believe without hereſie, it was the fourth part of another <hi>Stadium;</hi> and if ſo, <hi>Hannibals</hi> Interval between his ſecond and third Batallion was ſeven hundred and eighty one foot, that will be ſixty one foot more than I required between the ſecond and third <hi>Roman</hi> Batallions.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Lipſius</hi> would maintain his conjecture with two Inſtances out of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but when they are examined, they may happily make more againſt him, than for him. The firſt is, when <hi>Afranius</hi> was to fight with <hi>Caeſar</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> the ground between the two Camps where the two Armies were ranged was but two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot, whereof ſaith <hi>Caeſar,</hi> every Army took up a third, the third Third being left for the Charge. Will <hi>Lipſius</hi> infer from this, that the Interval between<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lipſius</hi> his firſt Inſtance conſuted.</note> the firſt and ſecond Batallion was but of fifty foot, and that between the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and the third only of one hundred? No ſuch matter, for where the ground was ſo ſcarce, three foot between ranks was enough; and I doubt if ever more was allowed to the heavy armed, nay nor ſo much, after their <hi>Pila</hi> were caſt; a third part of two thouſand foot will be ſix hundred ſixty-ſix. Draw up all the three Batallions one behind another, make each of them ten deep, they will make in all thirty Ranks, for which allow twenty nine diſtances, each of three foot, will make eighty-ſeven foot, and thirty foot being allowed for the thirty ranks to ſtand on, will amount to one hundred and ſeventeen foot, on which ground all the thirty ranks could conveniently enough ſtand. Now we have five hundred forty nine foot for the Tranſverſe Intervals, which were two. Of the five hundred forty nine foot, allow two hundred to the Interval between the firſt and ſecond Batallion, and three hundred forty nine for the Interval between the ſecond and the third. But here you will ſay, the two Tranſverſe Intervals had not ſo great a ſpace of ground as I required for them; I grant it you, and what then; I did not oblige <hi>Roman</hi> Generals to allow ſo much ground when they had it not, but to give as much when conveniently they could. And even here I have demonſtrated, that though <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Afranius</hi> were pinched for want of ground, yet both of them might have allowed more by fifty foot to the leaſt of the Tranſverſe Intervals, than <hi>Lipſius</hi> doth to both the Intervals.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Inſtance is, when <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſays, <hi>Pompey</hi> drew up his army in <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> ſo near his Camp, that darts could have been caſt out of his fortifications over the heads of all his three Batallions, and therefore he concludes the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals between them muſt have been of a very ſmall extent. To this I give a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold<note place="margin">His ſecond Inſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> anſwer: Firſt, I ſuppoſe theſe Darts were to be caſt out of Scorpions, Onagers, and Catapults, and if theſe, or any of them could ſhoot Spears (as it is written of them) over the <hi>Danube,</hi> where it is broadeſt, then I believe (though I never ſaw that River) they could throw Darts more than four Stadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums, or Furlongs, which will be two thouſand five hundred foot, and all the ground I require for a <hi>Roman</hi> Army Marſhall'd in three Batallions one behind an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, allowing ſix foot between Ranks, and three hundred and ſixty between the firſt and the ſecond Batallion, and ſeven hundred and twenty between the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97406:61"/> ſecond and the third, amounts to no more but twelve hundred and ſeventy two foot.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond anſwer is, that at that time <hi>Pompey</hi> had no mind to fight, and therefore drew up near his Camp, that he might fall back to it, when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, (as he then did) and ſo in Marſhalling needed not keep the ordinary cuſtom of Intervals.</p>
                  <p>But the Intervals <hi>Lipſius</hi> gives between one Maniple and another in all the three <hi>Roman</hi> Claſſes of Foot which were called the direct ways or ſtreets, not theſe Tranſverſe ones whereof I have ſpoken, are yet more irrational, and his<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lipſius</hi> his direct Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> conjecture of them leſs obvious to ſenſe, as of the other. He ſaith if the <hi>Velites</hi> be to ſtand in theſe Intervals, they may be of twenty or thirty foot, if not of ten. But I ſay firſt, if the <hi>Velites</hi> ſtand there, they are no Intervals at all. Next, if they be ordered to ſtand between the Maniples of the heavy armed, as much of ground muſt be allowed them, as wherein they can conveniently ſtand and fight; now that cannot be certain, but according to their number, as ſuppoſe them twelve in front, (whether ten, ſix or four deep, it matters not) <hi>Lipſius</hi> muſt allow them twelve foot for their twelve Files to ſtand on, and thirty three foot for eleven diſtances between Files, and that is forty five foot: Where are then <hi>Lipſius</hi> his twenty or thirty foot. But <hi>Lipſius</hi> knew well enough that the <hi>Velites</hi> were not to ſtand in the intervals of the heavy armed, but only either to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to the Van, or retire to the Reer through them; and he knew too that the intervals between Maniples were principally for the Maniples of the firſt Claſs to fall in the intervals of the ſecond Claſs, and the Intervals of the third Batal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion for the Maniples of the other two to full back to them: and therefore to allow but ten foot for every one of theſe Intervals is an inexcuſable error in him, and a conjecture which hath no coherence with ſenſe, nor can ever be juſtified by reaſon. That General never breath'd that could draw up a band of men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of twelve Files in ten foot of ground. Now every Maniple of the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes</hi> and <hi>Haſtati,</hi> according to <hi>Polybius</hi> whom <hi>Lipſius</hi> follows, conſiſted of one hundred and twenty men, and theſe being ten deep, conſtituted twelve Files, theſe have eleven Intervals, every one of which being three foot, make thirty three foot; add twelve to that for the twelve Files to ſtand on, the aggregate<note place="margin">True Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals between] Maniples.</note> is forty five foot, and if you allow but two foot for every Interval between Files, the Interval between two Maniples muſt be thirty four foot, for it is not poſſible you can allow leſs ground for an Interval than that which a Body poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that is ordain'd to ſtand in that Interval. Hence I think it is obvious to common ſenſe, that all the Intervals between the Maniples of the <hi>Haſtati</hi> and <hi>Principes,</hi> were of forty five foot, or thirty four at leaſt. And thoſe of the <hi>Triarii</hi> of ninety foot, or ſixty eight at leaſt, in regard they were to receive the Maniples of both the <hi>Haſtati</hi> and <hi>Principes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the clearing this point of Diſtances I have been perhaps too prolix, and have uſed repetitions, which I condemn in others; but being it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to have ſo much as a general notion of a <hi>Roman</hi> Army, how it was Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall'd, (or of any other Army) unleſs you know the Intervals, I have not thought it amiſs to ſpend a little paper on that Subject. And indeed we are left as in many other Points (neceſſary to be known) ſo in this, to grope in the dark. Nor have I been ſo ſevere to the learned <hi>Lipſius</hi> for his extravagant conjectures of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Intervals, but I ſhall be ready to accept (and deſire others to do ſo too) of his own excuſe, which I ſhall give you in his own words, as I find them in the fourth Book of his Commentary. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Hence came theſe many grievances of the Confederated Towns, mentioned in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories, and once a total rupture of the <hi>Latins</hi> from them, till after much blood-ſhed they were reduced to their former condition.</p>

                     </note> Book of his Art of War, ſays that every Conſular Army conſiſted of two Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, which were eleven thouſand Foot, and two Legions of Allies, which made alſo eleven thouſand Foot. I ſhall firſt ſpeak a word to both of them together, and then ſeverally to each of them. Both of them had read <hi>Livy,</hi> and till they had produced a more Authentick Hiſtorian, none of them ſhould have given him the lye ſo broadly. This Author in his Twenty firſt Book tells us, that after <hi>Hannibal</hi> came to <hi>Italy, Cor. Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Sempronius</hi> levied ſix Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Romans</hi> each of four thouſand Foot, and for every one of them three hundred Horſe, and in that ſame place he caſts up the total of them to be twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four thouſand Foot, and eighteen hundred Horſe, and of Allies ſaith he, forty four thouſand Foot, and four thouſand Horſe. This wanted but four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the double number of the <hi>Roman</hi> Foot, and four hundred more than double the number of the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe. In his Thirty fifth Book he informs us that in the War againſt <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Conſul <hi>Quintius</hi> raiſed two Legions, each of five thouſand Foot, in all ten thouſand, and ſix hundred Horſe; and of the Allies, ſaith he, twenty thouſand foot, and eight hundred Horſe. The number of the Foot was double the <hi>Roman</hi> Infantry, and the Horſe exceeded<note place="margin">Prov'd out of <hi>Livius.</hi>
                     </note> the <hi>Roman</hi> by two hundred. In the <hi>Iſtrian</hi> War, a little before that of <hi>Macedon,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97406:62"/> Livy</hi> in his forty firſt Book ſays, ten thouſand <hi>Roman</hi> Foot, and three hundred Horſe were levied, and of the Allies twelve thouſand Foot, and ſix hundred Horſe. And to make ſhort, hear him once for all in the Third Book of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. It was agreed and concluded, ſaith he, that the Army ſhould conſiſt of two parts Confederates, (theſe then were the <hi>Latins</hi> and the <hi>Hernicks</hi>) and one third part Citizens. If theſe Inſtances evince not the raſhneſs of that aſſertion, that the Allies were never ſtronger than the <hi>Romans,</hi> then <hi>Livy</hi> hath baſely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen'd us. But <hi>Vegetius</hi> will perhaps bring <hi>Polybius</hi> to ſupport him, who in his Sixth Book ſays, The Allies Foot were for moſt part equal with the <hi>Roman</hi> Foot, but their Horſe were double the number of the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer firſt, that by this account the Allies were ſtronger than the <hi>Romans,</hi> their Horſe being double the number of the other, and therefore they were not of equal ſtrength. Secondly, what if <hi>Polybius</hi> had ſaid that both <hi>Vegetius</hi> and<note place="margin">

Thirdly, he ſays not that the Foot were always of equal numbers, but <hi>ut plurimum,</hi> for the moſt part, and I queſtion the truth of that too. And laſtly, if he had meant they were always of a like ſtrength, he had foully contradicted himſelf; for in his Second Book he hath theſe words: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Hannibal,</hi> ſays he, invaded <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> levied againſt the <hi>Gauls</hi> four Legions, each conſiſting of five thouſand two hundred Foot, which were twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand eight hundred Foot, and for every Legion three hundred Horſe, which were twelve hundred; and of the Allies, ſaith he, were raiſed thirty thouſand Foot, and two thouſand Horſe. And in that ſame Book he ſaith, that the <hi>Roman</hi> preparations (I ſuppoſe againſt <hi>Hannibal</hi>) amounted to ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Foot, and twenty thouſand Horſe, a third part whereof (conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the ſenſe of that time) could not be <hi>Romans;</hi> and yet (ſaith this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian) <hi>Hannibal</hi> invaded them with few more than twenty thouſand men.</p>

                     </gap>old to ask <hi>Machiavelli,</hi> what he meant in the Third Book of his Art of War, where he ſays, though the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates Foot never exceeded the <hi>Roman</hi> Foot (the contrary whereof I have prov'd) yet their Horſe, ſays he, were permitted to be ſome more. Say you,<note place="margin">And <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velli</hi> of the Allies.</note> 
                     <hi>ſome more,</hi> yes indeed, <hi>ſome more,</hi> if it be true, what your ſelf ſaid a little before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe of a Conſular Army were but ſix hundred, and theſe of the Allies one thouſand four hundred: This is a <hi>ſome more</hi> indeed. But it is probable I may meet with him upon this very ſame ſubject in the next Chapter.</p>
                  <p>But we ſhall not be able to make an eſtimate of the marſhalling, marching, or encamping of a <hi>Roman</hi> Conſular Army, till we condeſcend on the number of the Allies, without whom few or none of them in ancient times went, to the fields. Let us therefore without further conteſt follow the authority of the famous Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian<note place="margin">We muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Polybius</hi> for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Allies.</note> and Captain <hi>Polybius,</hi> who (as I have cited his words already) ſays, the Allies for moſt part were equal in Infantry with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and double the number of their Cavalry. Then it will be clear, that not only in our Authors time, but often both before and after it, every Legion of the Allies conſiſted of four thouſand two hundred Foot, and their Horſe for every Legion were ſix hundred, becauſe we may conjecture probably out of <hi>Livy,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Legion was of that ſtrength, and that the Horſe were three hundred.</p>
                  <p>Out of the number of the Allies, by the Conſuls appointment, were taken thoſe whom the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians call Extraordinaries, and theſe were not a few, for they were the fifth part of the Foot, and the third of the Horſe; as ſuppoſe out of two Legions, conſiſting of eight thouſand four hundred Foot, one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand<note place="margin">The Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinaries of the Allies.</note> ſix hundred and eighty were taken, which was the fifth part, and out of twelve hundred Horſe, four hundred were taken, which was the third, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97406:63"/> theſe were the gallanteſt, beſt arm'd, beſt mounted, and of the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. There be ſome ſuch as <hi>Lipſius</hi> and <hi>Terduzzi,</hi> (who would gladly make us believe they have converſed with the Ghoſts of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Politicians, and ſo know their <hi>Arcana</hi> and ſecrets) who ſay this was done under the mask of an<note place="margin">An idle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</note> honourable employment, to keep them at a diſtance from their friends, that they might not combine to the prejudice of the <hi>Roman</hi> State; and they ſay that upon this ſame account the reſt of the <hi>Socii</hi> and Allies were in March, Camp and Battel, kept aſunder by the interpoſition of the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Infantry: I may believe it was ſo, becauſe I never heard any ancient <hi>Roman</hi> ſay any thing to the contrary. But if theſe Confederates had intended to have betrayed at any time their Imperious Allies, the <hi>Romans,</hi> they might eaſily have contriv'd the matter either in Camp or Battel, to have joined with an Enemy to the evident deſtruction of as many <hi>Romans</hi> as were then in the Fields: For in Battel the left-hand Legion of the Allies, and all their Cavalry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marſhall'd together, might without any ſtop have ſtept over to an enemy, as in the diſcourſe of a Conſular Army will appear. And in a Camp the two ſides of it were recommended to the care of the Allies, (as you will ſee in their <hi>Caſtrametation</hi>) and ſoon may a man be deceived who truſts the Aphoriſm, <hi>Diſce diffidere,</hi> Learn to diſtruſt. If all this might have been true, where <hi>Roman</hi> and Allies Legions were of equal ſtrength, ſure in Armies where the Allies were far more numerous than the <hi>Romans,</hi> they might if they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, have done miſchief enough.</p>
                  <p>Out of theſe Extraordinaries were ſome choſen both of Horſe and Foot, and theſe were called <hi>Selecti,</hi> as <hi>Polybius</hi> his Interpreter renders it, or <hi>Ablecti,</hi> as<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Selecti</hi> of the Allies.</note> 
                     <hi>Lipſius</hi> will have it to be. Theſe, ſays <hi>Polybius,</hi> did not only lodge in the Camp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Tribunes, and near the General, but alſo in Battel, and on other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they uſed to attend the Conſul, and the Queſtor, but of what number theſe <hi>Selecti,</hi> were, neither <hi>Polybius,</hi> or for any thing I know any for him, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Legions and Horſe-Troops of Allies were Officer'd, Marſhall'd, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, and Diſciplin'd according to the <hi>Roman</hi> cuſtom, only with this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that thoſe who commanded <hi>Roman</hi> Legions were called Tribunes, but thoſe who commanded the Legions of the Allies were called <hi>Prafecti.</hi> I conceive the reaſon of the difference of the title was this, the Tribune was elected for moſt part by the Tribes, whence he had his name <hi>Tribunus;</hi> but thoſe of the<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Roman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls power over the Allies.</note> Allies were nominated by the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls (for the Allies had no power to appoint or Commiſſionate their own <hi>Praefecti;</hi> that had intrencht too much upon the Lordly power the <hi>Romans</hi> ſtill kept in their own hands) and were bound moſt ſtrongly to obey that Conſul with whom they join'd. So we ſee how little difference the haughty <hi>Romans</hi> made between their Confederated friends and their vaſſals, which I hinted in the beginning of this Chapter; and in this point the Conſuls had more power over the Allies than over the <hi>Romans</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for the <hi>Roman</hi> people for moſt part choſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Tribunes, and not the Conſuls.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of a <hi>Roman</hi> Conſular army, and ſome Miſtakes concerning it.</head>
                  <p>I Know not from whence this denomination of a Conſular Army is come, unleſs it be that <hi>Polybius</hi> in his Sixth Book ſaith, that ordinarily every year four Legions were levied for the States ſervice, two for every Conſul, and this <hi>Livy</hi> doth witneſs to have been done often. But neither the one nor the other hath aſſerted that a Conſul never had more or fewer Legions in his Army than two. <hi>Polybius</hi> means that a Conſular Army conſiſted for moſt part of two <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Legions; ſix hundred Horſe, with two Legions of Allies, and twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe. But he never ſaid that it was conſtantly ſo, for then he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted his own Hiſtory in many places. But I rather conceive Authors call that a Conſular Army which had in it the above ſpecified number of Horſe and Foot, by the authority, and upon the word of <hi>Vegetius,</hi> who deſcribes both a Pretorian and a Conſular Army in the firſt Chapter of his Third Book. I ſhall<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vegetius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian, and a Conſular army;</note> faithfully <hi>Engliſh</hi> his words thus: <hi>The Ancients</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>having by exrerience learned to obviate difficulties, chuſed rather to have skilful than numerous Armies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> therefore they thought in Wars of leſſer moment, one Legion with the Auxiliaries, that is ten thouſand Foot, and two thouſand Horſe might ſuffice, which the Praetors as leſſer Chieftans often led in Expeditions. But if the enemy was reported to be ſtrong, then a Conſular power with twenty thouſand Foot, and four thouſand Horſe was ſent, with a greater Captain. But if an infinite multitude of the fierceſt Nations did rebell, then too great neceſſity forcing them, two Chieftans with two Armies were ſent, with this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that either the one Conſul, or both ſhould look to it, that the Commonwealth ſhould receive no damage. In fine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſince the</hi> Roman <hi>people was to make War almoſt</hi>
                     <note place="margin">And contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelf,</note> 
                     <hi>every year in ſeveral Countries, againſt divers enemies, they thought theſe forces might ſuffice, becauſe they judged it was not ſo profitable to entertain great Armies, as thoſe that were well exerciſed and trained in Armes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far <hi>Vegetius:</hi> let us take his Diſcourſe in pieces, and examine it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own writings, and no mans elſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In the ſixth Chapter of his ſecond Book, he avers, there ſhould be no<note place="margin">Firſt in the Pretorian army,</note> fewer in a Legion than ſix thouſand one hundred Foot, and ſeven hundred twenty ſix Horſe: in this place, he ſaith, a <hi>Praetorian</hi> Army, (wherein there ſhould be a Legion of <hi>Romans,</hi> and another of Allies) ſhould have ten thouſand Foot, and two thouſand Horſe; the Foot two thouſand two hundred fewer than in his own account there ſhould be in two Legions, and the Horſe five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred forty eight more than himſelf allows to the Cavalry of two Legions. And to let us ſee, that he will keep a proportionable way in contradicting<note place="margin">Secondly in a Conſular army,</note> himſelf, he ſays, againſt a ſtrong Enemy a Conſul was ſent with twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and four thouſand Horſe; and that is, as he explains himſelf in the fourth Chapter of his ſecond Book, two Legions of <hi>Romans,</hi> with the help of the Allies; now I beſeech you hear him ſpeak for himſelf; and firſt, in the ſixth Chapter of his ſecond Book he ſays, that the Legion muſt conſiſt of ſix thouſand one hundred Foot, and ſeven hundred twenty ſix Horſe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, In this firſt Chapter of his third Book, he makes four Legions of the <hi>Roman</hi> and Allies Foot to be but twenty thouſand, which by his own rule ſhould have been twenty four thouſand four hundred; for his words formerly were, that no Legion ſhould be under ſix thouſand one hundred, and thoſe heavy armed too; and whereas by his own appointment, in the ſixth Chapter of his ſecond Book, every Legion ſhould have had ſeven hundred twenty ſix Horſe, more than any other Author allow'd: In this Chapter he increaſed their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to one thouſand, for he orders the Horſe of four Legions to be full four thouſand, the Foot of a Conſular Army four thouſand four hundred below,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97406:64"/> and the Horſe one thouſand ninety ſix above his own allowance. You ſee how <hi>Vegetius</hi> claſheth with <hi>Vegetius,</hi> it is not I that quarrel with him.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, he ſaith, if an infinite multitude of fierce Nations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled; Rebelled, againſt whom? Certainly he means againſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> but how could they rebel, before they profeſt to be ſubject? Aſſuredly, theſe fierce Nations he ſpeaks of, ſwore neither fealty nor homage to <hi>Romulus,</hi> nor <hi>Rome</hi> when<note place="margin">His inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,</note> he firſt founded it. If they defended themſelves, ſo long as they could, from the dominion of ſtrangers, they did what nature commanded them, and were no Rebels. He will find <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf, after long and bloody Wars, never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a Province till <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s time. You ſee what words his Inadvertency prompts him to utter. In this caſe of a great Rebellion, he ſays, two Conſuls with the Armies were joyn'd together, with a command to look to it, that the Common-wealth ſuffer'd no damage. But this command was given many times when two Conſuls did not, nor needed not bring their forces together.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, You have heard him aver, that in the great wars, which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> State manag'd, their greateſt Army conſiſted of twenty thouſand Foot, and four thouſand Horſe, twenty four thouſand in all; and that two of thoſe Armies joyn'd together, making of both forty eight thouſand Combatants, did ſuffice in the greateſt danger. Truly <hi>Vegetius,</hi> if <hi>Hannibal</hi> had been alive<note place="margin">His contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſtory.</note> when you wrote this, he could have inform'd you, that he forc'd your Maſters, the <hi>Romans,</hi> to joyn two ſuch Armies and more, before ever they had to do with thoſe fierce Nations you ſpeak of; except a few <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>Ciſalpine</hi> or <hi>Italian Gauls;</hi> unleſs you take the <hi>Sicilians</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to be thoſe fierce Nations; with the firſt whereof they quarrel'd and invaded them, and with the ſecond broke Peace, without either regard to Juſtice, or ſenſe of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. But tell me, had the two Conſuls at <hi>Cannae,</hi> no more but forty eight thouſand <hi>Romans</hi> and Allies? read <hi>Polybius</hi> his fourth Book, you will ſee they had eight Legions of <hi>Romans,</hi> and as many Allies, at five thouſand Foot each Legion, and three hundred Horſe, and theſe extended to eighty thouſand Foot, and ſeven thouſand two hundred Horſe, reckoning the Allies Cavalry double that of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Read <hi>Livy</hi>'s twenty ſecond Book, you will ſee <hi>Hannibal</hi> kill'd at that ſame Battel, forty five thouſand <hi>Roman</hi> Foot, and two thouſand ſeven hundred Horſe, beſides Allies; and the ſame Hiſtorian will tell you in plain language, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Army at that place conſiſted of fourſcore and ſeven thouſand fighting men. And before <hi>Hannibal</hi> enter'd <hi>Italy,</hi> had the <hi>Romans</hi> no ſtronger Armies againſt the <hi>Gauls</hi> than forty eight thouſand men? Yes, both <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi> will tell you of far greater numbers, read in other Hiſtories whether <hi>Marius</hi> had but forty eight thouſand <hi>Romans</hi> againſt the fierce Nations of the <hi>Cimbrians</hi> and the <hi>Teutones.</hi> How vain a thing it is then for an Author of <hi>Vegetius</hi> his reputation to aver, that againſt the mightieſt Enemy, two Conſular Armies, each of twenty four thouſand men, were ſufficient, againſt the current of Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He lays it down for an unqueſtionable truth, that one Conſul<note place="margin">A bold aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi>
                     </note> had never more than two Legions of <hi>Romans,</hi> and as many of the Allies, againſt the moſt powerful Enemy. Be pleas'd to hear his own words, in the fourth Chapter of his Second Book: <q rend="inline">

If two Legions were ſufficient in any War, why were four Legions and two Conſuls, imployed againſt the fierce Nations, he juſt now ſpoke of? But I will come nearer him, and tell him, that it is very often found in Authors, that one Conſul or General had the Conduct of more than two Legions, and therefore <hi>Vegetius</hi> his words that I cited laſt muſt either be falſe, or thoſe Authors whom I ſhall cite, do groſsly abuſe us. I ſhall not repeat the buſineſs of <hi>Canna;</hi> but be pleas'd to take theſe other Inſtances.</p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:97406:64"/>
                  <p>When <hi>Caeſar</hi> heard of the dreadful preparations of the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> to ſtop<note place="margin">Inſtances of later times to the contrary: Of <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
                     </note> that inundation, he poſts to <hi>Italy,</hi> and raiſes two new Legions, joyns them with three <hi>Veterans,</hi> brought them to <hi>France,</hi> and with one he had there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, he made ſix in all, and with theſe fought the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> and thereafter, <hi>Arioviſtus,</hi> all in one Summer. This he writes in the ſecond Book of the <hi>Gallick</hi> War. Here were more than two Legions, yet but one Conſul. In his fifth Book he ſays, he invaded <hi>England</hi> with five Legions, beſides a vaſt number of <hi>Gauls, Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians,</hi> and <hi>Balearians,</hi> having left his Legate <hi>Labienus</hi> in <hi>Gaule</hi> with 3 Legions, and three thouſand Horſe; here a Conſuls Legate commanded more Legions than two. The moſt part of the time <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſtay'd in <hi>Gaule,</hi> he had ten Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, till <hi>Pompey</hi> and the Senate cheated him of two of them. <hi>Petreius</hi> and<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Petreius</hi> and <hi>Afranius, Pompey,</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Afranius</hi> had ſeven Legions in <hi>Spain, Pompey</hi> had eleven at <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> beſides a world of Auxiliaries; and there <hi>Caeſar</hi> had eight, and at <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> when he was in purſuit of the flying Senate, he had twelve Legions. Thus we ſee, that Great <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the moſt daring Conſul that ever was, thought not two Legions ſufficient againſt any Enemy, or in any War. Before his time, the two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> joyn'd their Armies together againſt the <hi>Cimbrians;</hi> and,<note place="margin">

                     </note> as <hi>Florus</hi> tells us, loſt in the Battel eighty thouſand <hi>Romans,</hi> and forty thouſand Servants and Baggage-men. Sure in theſe two Conſular Armies there were four Legions four times told. And the ſame Author ſays that <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvir,</hi> entered <hi>Media</hi> with eighteen Legions, and ſixteen thouſand Horſe, all theſe Conſuls and their Legates liv'd long before <hi>Vegetius,</hi> and I doubt not but he hath read all their ſtories: but I ſhall lead him up to thoſe times, when his<note place="margin">Of more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times,</note> 
                     <hi>Romans</hi> were not ſo powerful as to raiſe ſo numerous Legions, and yet in them we ſhall ſee that the Conſuls were not ſtinted to two Legions a piece, as he hath very confidently declared, they were: <hi>Polybius</hi> ſaith, that before the ſecond<note place="margin">Before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Punick</hi> War,</note> Punick War, the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſeveral hundred thouſands in arms; I hope then no man (except our Author) will ſay, that every Conſul had but two Legions allotted him. In the Conſulſhip of young <hi>Camillus,</hi> the City being environed<note place="margin">Young <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi>
                     </note> with enemies, ten Legions were levied; two of them were left for defence of <hi>Rome,</hi> four were given to the <hi>Prator,</hi> and <hi>Camillus</hi> took four to himſelf, each conſiſting of 4 thouſand two hundred Foot, and three hundred Horſe. Thus we ſee not only that a Conſular Army had four <hi>Roman</hi> Legions in it (a thing denied by <hi>Vegetius</hi>) but a Pretorian one had four, to which our Author allows but one. You may read this in <hi>Livy</hi>'s Seventh Book, and in that ſame place he tells us, that the Conſul <hi>Popilius Lenus</hi> marched with four full Legions againſt the enemy,<note place="margin">Popilius Lenus,</note> leaving a conſiderable army at <hi>Rome</hi> to wait on all hazards.

Obſerve, that at that time the <hi>Latines</hi> were Allies, and levied their proportions, as many Foot as the <hi>Romans</hi> did, and twice as many Horſe, if not more of both the one and the other. Obſerve alſo, that in thoſe times the <hi>Roman</hi> Seignory was of no large extent; for <hi>Livy</hi> ſpeaking of theſe Levies of <hi>Valerius,</hi> ſays, ſo many Legions were never levied before; he means, never at one time. Theſe are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent enough to prove <hi>Vegetius</hi> to have been too confident, when he ſaid that never <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul conducted more than two <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, even againſt the moſt numerous Enemies.</p>

I hope, the inſtances I have uſed againſt <hi>Vegetius</hi> in this ſame cauſe, may ſerve ſufficiently to confute <hi>Machiavelli.</hi> But here I muſt obſerve the <hi>Florentines</hi> preſumption, in the modelling his <hi>Roman</hi> Conſular Army.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97406:65"/> we never heard from any other Author, nor he from <hi>Vegetius;</hi> who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly for ſix thouſand one hundred Foot.

Let this, I ſay, be given, but not granted him; why concludes he poſitively, that two Conſular Armies conſiſted of fifty thouſand fighting men? Where did the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of <hi>Florence</hi> learn this Arithmetick, to make fifty the aggregate of twice twenty four? Yet if he be not guilty of more dangerous errors, we may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him this.

                  <p>IN ſo important an affair, upon the right or wrong managing of which, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the conſervation or ruine, not only of the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies, but of the State; <hi>Polybius</hi> affords us no more light than what he hath done in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalling the Legionary Foot; and if he be right in that, we are to look for little or no help from <hi>Vegetius,</hi> whoſe ordering of a Legion we have rejected; only we admit what he ſays in the fifteenth Chapter of his ſecond Book (though thereby he contradicts himſelf) that, <hi>Equites locantur in cornibus:</hi> The Horſe are placed in the Wings. But having in the ſeveral fore-going Chapters ſhown you how (as far as any Authors have given us light) the Foot were marſhall'd; of what number both they and the Horſe were, and how they were drawn up; of what number the Allies were, and how they were divided: I ſuppoſe, our buſineſs now is, how to joyn them in one Body or Army, and when it comes to a battel, to obſerve what cuſtomes were uſed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and other Ancients.</p>
                  <p>Though as either occaſion offer'd, emergency required, or neceſſity forced, the <hi>Roman</hi> Captains uſed ſeveral figures and forms of Battels, yet that which was moſt ordinary, and moſt uſed, was the quadrate or ſquare; but I do not at all mean an equilateral one, as <hi>Terduzzi</hi> would gladly have it to be, to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he puts himſelf to more trouble than he needs; and in doing ſo, he ſhews<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Terduzzi</hi> over nice.</note> himſelf more an Engineer (as I believe he was to <hi>Baſta</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Rodolph</hi> the Second's Captain General in <hi>Tranſilvania</hi>) than a Marſhal of a Field needs to be. But I mean ſuch a Quadrate or Square, as the General of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army imagined, that either the ground, the poſture of the Enemy, or his own deſigns did or might prompt him to make. But in regard we can ſay but little to Marſhalling, till we condeſcend, of what and how many members ordinarily the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies were compoſed, and though the numbers of both <hi>Roman</hi> and Allies Legions varied oft, yet becauſe for moſt part the Legion conſiſted of four thouſand two hundred Foot, and the Horſe were three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and that ordinarily two Legions, and ſix hundred Horſe were ſent to the Field with a Conſul, and that alſo for moſt part the Foot of the Allies was equal to that of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and almoſt conſtantly they were double their
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97406:65"/> number in Horſe; let us follow <hi>Polybius,</hi> and ſay the Conſular army conſiſted of ſixteen thouſand eight hundred Foot, and eighteen hundred Horſe, in all eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand ſix hundred.</p>
                  <p>Neither do I think I can tell you better how a <hi>Roman</hi> Army was Marſhall'd, when it was to fight, than to inform you how <hi>Scipio</hi> the Great, or the <hi>African</hi>

                     </note> drew up his Army when he was to fight againſt <hi>Syphax</hi> and <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> and that out of the Fourteenth Book of <hi>Polybius.</hi> There the Hiſtorian tells us that the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul drew up his Foot in the Body or Battel, firſt his <hi>Haſtati,</hi> next his <hi>Principes,</hi> and thirdly his <hi>Triarii;</hi> on the right wing were his <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe, and on the left his <hi>Numidians.</hi> And here our Author in one word, and once for all tells us, that it was the conſtant cuſtom of the <hi>Romans</hi> to Marſhall their Armies in that faſhion: His words are, <hi>Et in hoc Romanae Militiae conſuetudinem ſimpliciter ſervavit.</hi> And when the ſame <hi>Scipio</hi> fought againſt his redoubted enemy <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> he did the very like, only with this alteration, that he commanded his Legate <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lius</hi> to command the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry on the left wing, and ſet King <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> with his <hi>Numidian</hi> Horſe on the right.</p>
                  <p>This one example may teach us how the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies were ordinarily Embat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teled. But here is no word of the Allies. I ſuppoſe, if <hi>Scipio</hi> had any, as likely he had, their Horſe were join'd with the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe in one of the wings in both thoſe Battels, ſince the other wing at both times was given to the Auxiliary <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians.</hi> But where an Army was purely compoſed of <hi>Romans</hi> and Allies, they<note place="margin">Army of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies Marſhal'd together in the Field.</note> were Marſhalled (as we may gather out of <hi>Polybius</hi> his Sixth Book, and other Authors) in this manner, the <hi>Roman</hi> ſix hundred Horſe were placed on the right wing, upon their left-hand the firſt Legion of the Allies Foot, conſiſting of three thouſand four hundred (for eight hundred of it was taken out for Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinaries) upon the left-hand of the Allies firſt Legion, ſtood the firſt <hi>Roman</hi> Legion, and next it the ſecond; and upon the left-hand of it was Marſhalled the ſecond Legion of the Allies; and upon the left-wing ſtood the Confederates Cavalry to the number of eight hundred, for four hundred of their twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred were cull'd out for Extraordinaries. Now thoſe eight hundred Horſe of the Allies were divided into twenty Turmes or Troops, as the <hi>Roman</hi> ſix hundred Horſe were likewiſe, but with this difference, that in every Troop of the Allies there were forty Riders, but in the <hi>Roman</hi> Troops there were only thirty. Thus was the groſs or bulk of the <hi>Roman</hi> armies Marſhalled. As to the <hi>Evocati</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>Extraordinarii</hi> of the Allies, <hi>Polybius</hi> hath told us no more than<note place="margin">Station of the <hi>Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</note> what I have told you in my Diſcourſe of the Allies, that they were Encamped beſides the Conſul, and were to be near him in the field, and to wait on the Treaſurer alſo. But we are left by him and others to conjecture how, in what particular place or places, they were ordain'd to fight. And truly I ſhall be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily induced to believe that ſometimes the Conſul placed three hundred of the Allies Extraordinary Horſe on the right hand of the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe in the right wing, and ſo made that wing ſtronger by one hundred than the other, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the left wing had been two hundred ſtronger than the right. The fourth hundred of the Extraordinary Horſe, <hi>Terduzzi</hi> will have to ſtay with the Conſul, and probably they did ſo. The Allies Extraordinary Foot were divided into two great Squadrons, one whereof ſtood between the firſt Legion of the Allies, and the firſt Legion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> on the right-hand of the Battel; the ſecond Squadron ſtood on the left-hand of the ſecond <hi>Roman</hi> Legion, between it and the ſecond Legion of the Allies.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Lipſius</hi> and <hi>Terduzzi</hi> will have it to be, and I think it may be probable enough that it was ſo, yet I doubt none of theſe two can tell me, who told them that it was ſo. In another place <hi>Lipſius</hi> thinks that both the <hi>Evocati</hi> and <hi>Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narii,</hi> at the Conſuls command, join'd with the <hi>Triarii</hi> to reinforce the Battel, and truly this is not improbable, but the queſtion is where they ſtood before they were commanded to join with the <hi>Triarii?</hi> for as <hi>Lipſius</hi> Marſhals them in the Intervals of the <hi>Triarii,</hi> they would hinder the <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Haſtati</hi> to join with the <hi>Triarii.</hi> What <hi>Terduzzi</hi> ſaith on this ſubject, I ſuppoſe he hath out of <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius;</hi> for though they were coetaneous, yet I find <hi>Lipſius</hi> often cited by <hi>Terduzzi.</hi> But I ſhall wrong none of them, if I ſay that neither of them in this particular had more warrant than their own <hi>Leves conjectur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, &amp; fallacia veſtigia,</hi> as <hi>Lipſius</hi> calls them. If you will believe <hi>Vegetius</hi> in the eighteenth Chapter of his Third
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:97406:66"/> Book, the Conſul ſhould have made uſe of the <hi>Extraordinarii</hi> both Horſe and Foot to environ and ſurround the Enemies left wing: if you ask me why the Conſul might not as well have ſurrounded the enemies right wing as his left? I muſt anſwer you that <hi>Vegetius</hi> hath kept up the reaſon from us as a ſecret.</p>
                  <p>In that ſame Chapter <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſays, that the Commander in chief ſhould ſtand between the right wing of the Horſe and the Foot, as a fit place from whence he might take up his meaſures, and encourage and relieve both his Horſe and Foot. <hi>Lipſius</hi> and <hi>Terduzzi</hi> fix him to the <hi>Aquila,</hi> or the Eagle on the right<note place="margin">Station of a <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul in Battel.</note> hand of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legion. But <hi>Polybius</hi> ſaith in that Battel I juſt now ſpoke of, <hi>Scipio</hi> gave the right wing to <hi>Maſaniſſa,</hi> and the left to <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lius</hi> to command. It would ſeem then that himſelf ſtaid with the Foot, and ſo indeed he did, for he cauſed a retreat to be ſounded to the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> that he might advance with the <hi>Principes.</hi> But ſince I may gueſs as well as others, I ſuppoſe he ſtood between the two <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, and conſequently beſides the Eagle of the ſecond Legion, and aſſuredly that part being directly the Center of the army, it was in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the only proper place for a Captain-General; but when two Conſuls were joined together, it was not ſo, for ordinarily the one commanded the right wing of the Horſe, and the other the left. So it was at <hi>Cannae,</hi> where the <hi>Romans</hi> were beaten by <hi>Hannibal;</hi> ſo it was at <hi>Veſuvius,</hi> where <hi>Manlius</hi> got the Victory over the <hi>Latins,</hi> after the death of his Colleague <hi>Decius;</hi> ſo it was at <hi>Metaurus,</hi> where <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi> defeated and kill'd <hi>Aſdrubal.</hi> But indeed where there was but one Conſul or General, he ſeldom tyed himſelf to one place, but rode where he ſaw his Preſence was moſt needful. So did that <hi>Manlius</hi> I juſt now mentioned, ſo did <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and ſo did many others of the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Captains. And it had been no prejudice either to <hi>Lipſius</hi> or <hi>Terduzzi</hi> to have ſuffer'd a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul in a Conſular army to have ſtood where he pleaſed, either beſides the firſt Eagle, or the ſecond, or beſides none of them.</p>

                     <hi>Vegetius</hi> in the ninth, tenth, and eleventh Chapters of his Second Book ſpeaks of ſome more Offices in a Conſular army than <hi>Polybius</hi> doth, and theſe were three, <hi>Praefectus Legionis, Praef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So it ſeems he hath been a new Officer created after the Emperours came in play.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of ſeveral Figures of Armies uſed by the Ancients in their Battels.</head>
                  <p>IF a General or Commander in chief have not the choice of the ground where he is to fight, he muſt marſhall his army according to the advantages or difficulties of it. But if he may make choice of the place of Battel, then no doubt he may model his forces as he pleaſeth, without tying himſelf to any other preſcripts or precedents of others. Notwithſtanding which he muſt be very wary, not to caſt his army in ſuch a figure as carries along with it intricacy, ſuch as may make both the ordering and obſerving it difficult, and more eſpecially he was to be very ſhie of changing the Figure of his army in the time of action,<note place="margin">Dangerous to alter the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of an Army in time of action.</note> in regard that the bulk of an army is compoſed of ſuch members as are for moſt part rude, groſs, and of ſo dull underſtandings, that they are not able in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to apprehend the reaſons of ſudden alterations, or to dive into the deſigns of their great Commanders; and therefore a change of the form of a Battel, after an army is engaged, may caſt it into confuſion, which may quickly render it a prey to an attentive and vigilant enemy.</p>
                  <p>The Figures of Armies uſed by the Ancients, not only <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> but even of thoſe Nations, likewiſe whom both theſe were pleaſed to qualifie<note place="margin">Five Figures of Batallions.</note> with the title of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> were for moſt part of five kinds. Theſe were the Quadrate or Square, the Wedg, the <hi>Tenaille,</hi> or Tongs, the Saw, and the Globe.</p>
                  <p>The Quadrate or Square they ſubdivided into three ſorts, to wit, the <hi>Turrite,</hi> the <hi>Lying Lateritial,</hi> and the <hi>Simple Lateritial.</hi> The <hi>Turrite</hi> was that Battel<note place="margin">Quadrate Turrite.</note> whoſe height or depth was much greater than its front; As, draw up a thouſand
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97406:67"/> men ſix deep, let them face either to the right hand or left, you ſhall ſee them but ſix in front, and a hundred ſixty ſix deep, it is the <hi>Quadrate Turrite,</hi> ſo called becauſe its height or depth makes it look like a Tower; it was but ſeldom uſed, and indeed it is very uſeleſs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Simple Latrice</hi> is where all the <hi>Latera</hi> or ſides of the Battel, that is front,<note place="margin">Simple L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritial Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate.</note> reer, and both flanks are of a like extent. One hundred men drawn up ten deep, gives you the <hi>Simple lateritial Quadrate;</hi> becauſe it is a Battel equal on all ſides, it is alſo called the <hi>Aequilateral quadrate,</hi> of this form were the ancient <hi>Egyptian</hi> Battels, as I have told you in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Art of War: ten thouſand of their men Marſhall'd a 100 deep, made them a 100 in front, a 100 in reer, and a 100 in each flank, ſo that face them any way you pleaſe, ſtill they were a 100 in front.</p>
                  <p>The lying <hi>Lateritial</hi> ſquare, or quadrate, is a Battel in which the front is of a<note place="margin">Lying Lateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Quadrate.</note> greater extent than the flank, or where there are a great many more men in the rank, than in the file as 16000 men (after the <hi>Grecian</hi> way) Marſhall'd 16 deep, gives you a front of 1000 men, and the flank but of 16. And this was uſually both the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> way of Embattelling, and continues ſo ſtill in our Modern armies. So when you read in ſtory that an army march'd in a Quadrate form, as <hi>Livy</hi> ſpeaks both in his Second and Thirteenth Books, and <hi>Saluſt</hi> alſo ſays, that <hi>Marius</hi> marched againſt <hi>Jugurtha</hi> with a Quadrate army; you are to underſtand it, that they marched in order of Battel, ready to fight, and that the form of their Batallions was Quadrate, but do not imagin they were <hi>Aequilateral,</hi> or <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lateritial.</hi> It is from the Quadrate form (which the <hi>Romans</hi> call'd lying <hi>lateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>) conſiſting of four angles, that our word Squadron hath its denomination; a word uſed now (for any thing I know) in all <hi>Europaean</hi> Languages. By what I have ſaid it appears, that though it were granted to <hi>Terduzzi,</hi> as it is not, that the <hi>Romans</hi> drew up their Foot twelve deep; yet that will not conclude their<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Terduzzi</hi> nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly curious.</note> Batallions, whether leſſer Bodies or greater, to have been <hi>Aequilateral</hi> quadrate, as he would have them to be, for in their Maniples drawn up, as he would have them twelve deep (ſince every one of them conſiſted of an hundred and twenty men) they could make but ten Files; now ten in front, and twelve in file, makes no more an <hi>Aequilateral</hi> Batallion, than a hundred twenty men Marſhall'd ten deep, and twelve in front can repreſent that figure. This lying <hi>lateritial</hi> quadrate, whereof I now ſpeak, is that form of Battel whereof <hi>Vegetius</hi> is to be underſtood, when he ſpeaks of a quadrate army with a long front.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Wedg</hi> I have ſpoke of in my diſcourſes of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Militia, but I would not have my Reader to imagin that theſe Wedg-battels ſpoken ſo much of in ancient Hiſtories, were ſuch as are painted to us, beginning with one man, then<note place="margin">Wedg-figure.</note> two, next three, and ſo to the end of the Chapter (though that method might be well enough obſerved in a ſmall body either of Horſe or Foot) but they were Batallions condenſed, and at cloſe order, the point conſiſting of a good many men, yet pointed, becauſe the Body grew broader and broader, till you came to the Reer where it was broadeſt; for to imagin that in the heat of the fight, any Batallion of the moſt experienced Soldiers, can be ſuddenly caſt into ſo punctual a form, (as firſt one, then two) by the readieſt General that ever was, is a Speculation never reduced, or reducible to practice. And ſo you are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Wedg in which the <hi>Theban Epaminondas</hi> caſt ſome of his Infantry at the Battel of <hi>Mantinea,</hi> whereby he broke the <hi>Laconians,</hi> was not a <hi>flim-flam</hi> of one, two, three, and four, (he had no time to tell ſtraws) but a good maſſie body of men, perhaps of fifty, ſixty, ſeventy, or a hundred in front, growing greater till it came to the end. This Wedg-battel conſiſted of three angles, the foremoſt point making one, and the broad end furniſht the other two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and indeed it is a Triangle, but not an aequilateral one. I told you in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place out of <hi>Livius,</hi> how the <hi>Celtiberians</hi> had well near routed the Praetor <hi>Fulvius</hi> by their Wedg-battel, till he defeated them with a deſperate Charge of unbridled Horſes. He who thinks that this Wedg-battel of theſe <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How it is rightly to be underſtood.</note> began with one man at the point, and by equal degrees came to a great many at the end of the Wedg, hath a ſtrong imagination. <hi>Livy</hi> in his twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſecond Book calls that Batallion of <hi>Macedonians,</hi> (who ſtood ranged in Battel within the Walls of <hi>Cenchrea</hi> to receive the Aſſailants, when the <hi>Roman</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul was to ſtorm) a Wedg, and yet it was a Phalange condenſed, only ſmaller at the point, than at the reſt of its dimenſions. And he might have call'd it

                  <p>The Globe-battel was a Batallion that appear'd to be of a round figure, and<note place="margin">Globe, or Ring-figure.</note> if it was perfectly round, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have worded it well, in calling it a Ring, I find it oftner mention'd in modern than in ancient ſtories.

Mr. <hi>Elton</hi> gives us its figure, and tells us right ingeniouſly how it is made; but ſure it is not feaſible for great bodies to caſt themſelves into that figure. I incline to their opinion who think it was but a Wedg of a leſſer body, and being ſmaller ſeem'd more Circular. And I the rather think ſo, becauſe <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his Books of the <hi>Alexandrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> War, ſays, that <hi>Domitius</hi> one of his Legates ſav'd a Legion by caſting it in a Ring, when the reſt of his Army was routed at <hi>Nicop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Some have writ that the ſeveral Maniples of a <hi>Roman</hi> Legion did repreſent the Saw, taking the Bodies of the Maniples for the Teeth, and the Intervals for the body of the Saw.</p>
                  <p>But how could that be, for the Bodies of the Maniples, and the ſeveral Intervals between theſe Bodies, were all of one equal front, and ſo are not the teeth and body of a Saw; and unleſs theſe Maniples had been made a little ſharper at the front, than of either ten or twelve men, the reſemblance would not have holden.

After theſe things the Army was marſhall'd in the Field; whereof I have already ſpoken ſufficiently.</p>
                  <p>Being ready to come to the ſhock, the <hi>Teſſera,</hi> or Word was given, which<note place="margin">The <hi>Teſſera,</hi> or Word.</note> all, both Officers and Common Souldiers received, that by it they might know one another, and ſo diſcern an Enemy. The <hi>Teſſera</hi> was either one Word, or one Sentence, as <hi>Foelicitas, Libertas, Venus Genetrix,</hi> (one of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>'s) <hi>Optima Mater,</hi> given by <hi>Nero,</hi> The worſt of Sons. Among the Emperours, after their converſion to the Faith, <hi>Deus Nobiſcum,</hi> God with us, was ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and ſo it continues to be often uſed among the <hi>German, Daniſh,</hi> and <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> Armies. Next to the Word, was the Shout, and this either was not, or ſhould not be raiſed, till the Armies were at that diſtance, that they could immediately come to blows: This was done to encourage their own men,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Baritus,</hi> or ſhout.</note> and terrifie their Enemies. <hi>Livius</hi> in his fourth Book informs us, that where
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97406:69"/> this cry or ſhout was very loud, ſhrill, and continued without interruption; it was interpreted to be a certain ſign of Victory: but if it was dead, cold, and unequal, often begun, and often interrupted, it bewray'd fear and diſcouragement, and portended ruine and deſtruction. It was uſed by all Nations, as well as the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the word <hi>Baritus,</hi> whereby Hiſtorians expreſs it, was borrowed from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Germans,</hi> whoſe cry, they ſay, ſounded like the pronunciation of that word. They cryed no more after they came to the medley, elſe it would have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them from hearing the Commands of their Officers, either by word of mouth, or the Trumpet. Though the loud noiſe of Cannon and Musket in our Modern Wars, may ſeem reaſon enough to ſuppreſs this ancient cuſtome of ſhouting, yet it neither ought to be, nor yet is it baniſh'd out of our Armies.

                     <hi>Roman</hi> Dictator <hi>Coſſus</hi> (as <hi>Levy</hi> hath it in his ſixth Book) being to joyn Battel with a powerful Army of the <hi>Volſcians,</hi> commanded all his Foot to ſtand ſtill, and fix their Javelines in the ground, and ſo receive the Enemies charge; which being violent, put them out of breath, and then the Legionaries clos'd with them, and routed them. Great <hi>Pompey</hi> gave the like order at <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> but not with the like ſucceſs, for he was totally beaten. But <hi>Machiavelli</hi> with<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Machiavelli</hi>'s opinion.</note> his accuſtomed confidence (to give it no worſe name) in the fourth Book of his Art of War, takes upon him to give the definitive ſentence, and awards the Victory to him who receives the charge: And ſaith alſo, that moſt Captains chuſe rather to receive than give it, yet he inſtances only one of the <hi>Fabii,</hi> who, by receiving the charge of the <hi>Sanonites</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> was Victorious. But we muſt liſten to a greater Captain than any he hath named, and himſelf to boot, and that is <hi>Julius Caeſar:</hi> who by giving the charge in the <hi>Theſſalian</hi> Plains, gain'd the Soveraignty of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and blames <hi>Pompey</hi> for following the bad advice of <hi>Triarius,</hi> to wait till <hi>Caeſar</hi> charged him.

                  <p>In the time of Battel, all, both Commanders and Souldiers did their duties, by punctually, obeying the commands of their Generals, though to the certain and inevitable loſs of their lives; if not, they were ſure to incur thoſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, whereof I ſhall ſpeak hereafter. Nor were they obliged to obey the commands given them before the Battel only, but all thoſe orders and ſigns that were given them in the time of Battel: Theſe <hi>Vegetius</hi> in the fifth Chapter of his third Book, calls Signs, and divides them into three<note place="margin">Signs in time of Battel.</note> ſorts, Vocal, Semi-vocal, and Dumb. The Vocal were the verbal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Officers, eſpecially the Conſul, and Tribunes. The Semi-vocal were the ſeveral ſounds of <hi>Claſſicums,</hi> Trumpets, and Horns; as <hi>March, Charge, Retire.</hi> The Dumb ſigns were the Enſigns, Standards, and Eagles; as alſo the elevation of the Hand, of a Colours, or a Lance, or the ſhaking of a Spear by a Conſul, or General: But theſe were agreed on before the fight began, and were either given to the whole Army, or but to a part of it; as, when you ſee ſuch a thing done, then you are to do ſo and ſo. Theſe Dumb ſigns would not do much good in our Battels, where the ſmoak of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would render many of them imperceptible.</p>
                  <p>And now the Battel is ended, and the <hi>Romans</hi> are either Victorious, or have loſt the day: If the firſt, they were to purſue the Enemy to his Camp,<note place="margin">To purſue a Victory,</note> or clearly out of the Field; and not only ſo, but to follow him ſo cloſe, that he might have no time to rally, and to force him out of his ſtrong holds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he recover'd breath to gather ſtrength. But we ſhall find not only <hi>Hannibal</hi> defective in this ſo important a Duty of a Great Captain, but many of the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves, even againſt this <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Arch-enemy of theirs. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> informs us in his twenty ſeventh Book, that at <hi>Canuſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The ſame Author tells us in his twenty ninth Book, that the Conſul <hi>Sempronius,</hi> and Pro-conſul <hi>Licinius</hi> fought with the ſame <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the <hi>Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In his thirty firſt Book he ſays, <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> was worſted by the <hi>Romans</hi> in two Horſe fights, but not being purſued by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, and leaving great Fires in the Camp, he eſcap'd to the Mountains. <hi>Caeſar</hi> defies all his Enemies to challenge or charge him with this overſight; for he never<note place="margin">Never omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
                     </note> beat one of them in the Field, (which he did very often) but he was ſure to be Maſter of his Camp before he ſlept. But you may read all along in <hi>Livy,</hi> when the <hi>Roman</hi> State was but beginning to grow, that when their Dictators or Conſuls had beaten any of their Neighbours, <hi>Tuſcans, Veians, Volſcians, Samnites</hi> or <hi>Latines,</hi> for moſt part, they made no more ado, but march'd back to the City, which, I ſuppoſe, the ambition of a Triumph frequently led them to.</p>
                  <p>But if theſe very often Victorious <hi>Romans</hi> receiv'd the foil, as ſometimes they did, they did even that which many more ancient people did before them, and many younger have done ſince; and that is, they either fled, or retir'd: If they fled downright, without taking notice of their Camp, either their ſpeed carried them away, or they ſaved their lives, by ſubmitting to ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as themſelves often impoſed upon thoſe, who by the chance of War, came to be their Captives; of which I ſhall ſpeak in my diſcourſe of Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Of what advantage or diſadvantage flying or retiring to a Camp was,<note place="margin">Of a Retreat to a Camp.</note> ſhall be touched, when I come to view <hi>Lipſius</hi> his compariſon of the Ancient and Modern Militia. In this place I ſhall only ſay, that the <hi>Romans</hi> did not always leave their Camps fortified and mann'd, when they went out to Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. At <hi>Ciminia,</hi> the Conſul <hi>Fabius</hi> made his Baggage-men demoliſh the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of his Camp, and fill up the Ditches, while he put his Army in Battel
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97406:70"/> array, in which he iſſued out, fought the Enemy, and beat him, as you have it in <hi>Livy</hi>'s ninth Book.

I ſhall therefore tell you, how <hi>Polybius</hi> ordereth the march of a Conſular Army, without ſtaying for <hi>Lipſius</hi> his tedious explications.</p>
                  <p>At the firſt ſound of the Trumpets and Horns, every man gather'd his<note place="margin">Preparations to a March.</note> Baggage, Burthens, and Fardels together, and had them ready to truſs up, if they were Officers, on their Pack and Sumpter horſes; if common Souldiers, on their own Backs: At the ſecond ſound they loaded either themſelves, or their Beaſts: And at the third ſound they marched. Now, though <hi>Polybius</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it not, nor <hi>Lipſius,</hi> (who will comment on him) yet we are to believe, that all Conſuls were ſo diſcreet that they made no great Interval of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſecond and third ſound, becauſe it could not be very pleaſing to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man or Beaſt, ſtanding under heavy burthens, to loſe any of that time which they might have ſav'd in making their Journey.</p>
                  <p>After the third ſound, they marched in this order: Firſt, marched the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinaries<note place="margin">Order of the <hi>Roman</hi> March.</note> of the Allies, as being neareſt the Conſuls Pavilion, and near to the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Port. Theſe were follow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d by the firſt Legion of the Allies, and after it, the Baggage of the Extraordinaries, and of that firſt Legion. In the third place march'd the firſt Legion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and its Baggage after it. Fourthly, The ſecond <hi>Roman</hi> Legion, followed by both its Baggage, and the Baggage of the ſecond Legion of the Allies: Which in the fifth place was follow'd by the ſecond Legion of the Allies, that was in the Rear of the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The place where the Cavalry was to march, was uncertain; ſometimes both Extraordinary and Ordinary Horſe march'd all in the Van, ſometimes in the Rear, ſometimes on both the Flanks, without the Baggage, according as the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reſolv'd to make uſe of them; taking up his meaſures by the nearneſs of an Enemy in either Van, Rear, or Flank: And ſometimes the Cavalry march'd divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Van and Rear. <hi>Polybius</hi> ſhews us alſo, that if there were ground enough, and great ſuſpicion of an Enemy, then the Baggage of the <hi>Haſtati</hi> of every Legion was ſent before them, which they followed themſelves, after them came the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97406:70"/> of the <hi>Principas,</hi> and then themſelves followed in the third place, by the Baggage of the <hi>Triarii,</hi> which themſelves follow'd. If an Enemy appear'd in the Van, the Baggage of the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> was immediately turn'd to a ſide, and the place where it had been, was poſſeſs'd by the <hi>Haſtati</hi> themſelves; the ſame was done by the <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Triarii.</hi> And we may ſuppoſe, that if an Enemy appear'd in the Rear, the Baggage of the <hi>Triarii</hi> was turn'd aſide, and its place poſſeſs'd by converſion; or facing to the Rear by themſelves, and the other two Batallions in that ſame manner were to ſecond them. What I have ſaid of one Legion, is ſpoken of all the four of a Conſular Army, the two <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, and the two of the Allies.</p>
                  <p>But in <hi>Polybius</hi> his deſcription of the march of a Conſular Army, there ariſe<note place="margin">Some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the march of the Baggage.</note> to me ſome difficulties, which <hi>Lipſius</hi> hath not at all clear'd, nay, nor ſpoken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f; though he ſpeak enough of that, which may be well enough underſtood without him. As firſt, conſider how it can be imagin'd, that the ground would always allow the <hi>Romans</hi> to march in the order I laſt ſpoke of, that is, every great Batallion of a Legion to have its Baggage in the Van of it: For by ſuch<note place="margin">Not at all clear'd by <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius,</hi> or any other.</note> a March, in a Countrey full of Hedges, Ditches and Incloſures, it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, but their Legions would be wonderfully embaraſs'd with their Servants, Horſes, and Baggage; neither could the three Batallions of every Legion, or of all the three, upon the attack of an Enemy make their evolutions from among their Baggage ſo dextrouſly and readily, but they might by an active purſuer, be brought to inextricable difficulties. I am therefore of opinion, that Time hath robb'd us of a page or two of <hi>Polybius</hi> his Writings, which would have explain'd this, and have made us know his own ſenſe, better than either <hi>Lipſius</hi> or <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rduzzi</hi> doth. The laſt of theſe two doth wonderfully pleaſe himſelf in affirming, that an Army ſhould always march in that very order, wherein he who commands it, reſolves to fight. Here he fights with his own ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, for, I ſuppoſe, none will deny, that an Army ſhould march in Batalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, great Bodies, Brigades, and Squadrons, yea, all in Breaſt, if the ground will permit it. But if not, then I hope, <hi>Terduzzi</hi> will permit a General to march in ſuch Bodies, ſmall or great, as with conveniency he can. But what if I deny to <hi>Terduzzi</hi> the thing it ſelf, for I dare aver, never <hi>Roman</hi> Chieftain intended to fight an Enemy in that order, as <hi>Polybius</hi> makes the Conſular Army to march: For who will fancy the <hi>Haſtati</hi> fought with their Baggage before them, or that the <hi>Principes</hi> advanced to the relief of the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> through their own Waggons and Carts? But grant him all he ſays, to be true, what is that to the thing in queſtion, which is, whether the ordering the Baggage to march between the ſeveral Batallions of a Legion, was conducible to obtain the great and main end and ſcope of all Armies, which is to overcome an Enemy? And ſince I think it was not, I am ſtill of the opinion, that <hi>Polybius</hi> his right meaning is not yet fully elucidated to us, either by himſelf, or any other perſon whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>And I will deal yet more freely, I do not well, or rather not at all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,<note place="margin">

If an Enemy marched from them, why did ſo pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a people as the <hi>Romans</hi> were, make their own Baggage a hinderance to them in overtaking that Enemy, in whoſe purſuit they marched?

If in the firſt, they had nothing to demand from their Hoſts, but Bed and Lodging, and were to pay for all they ſpent in meat, drink, or fire. In the time of the Emperours, the Legates and Preſidents of Provinces, cauſed them to furniſh the Armies (as they marched through their juriſdictions) out of the publick Magazines (which was diſcounted from their wages by the Treaſurers) or cauſed the Countrey people to bring in proviſions of all kinds, as to open Markets, where they were ſold to the Souldiers for ready money, at the ordinary rates of the Countreys, in which the Armies chanced to be; the contraveners and diſobeyers of orders being ſeverely puniſhed. The way in which Officers and Souldiers uſed to be quartered in Houſes (to avoid ſtrife between them and their Hoſts) was this: The whole houſe was as equally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as might be, into three parts, whereof the Maſter of the houſe choſe the firſt, the Souldiers the ſecond, and the third and laſt returned to the hoſt, who by this means had two thirds.</p>
                  <p>When the Army was to be quartered in the Field, which we call Encamping,<note place="margin">Souldiers hard labour in Encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> (and which conſiſteth of two parts, Caſtrametation and Fortification) the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers had a harder labour than in their days March, in regard, (beſide the meaſuring the ground) they were to Fortifie the Camp, with Ditch, Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and Palliſado, and to pitch the Tents of all their Commanders, and cleanſe their quarters, before they got leave to take notice of their own Tents, or Huts.</p>
                  <p>In the matter of Caſtrametation (which is one part of Encamping) after the <hi>Roman</hi> way, we are to borrow all our light from <hi>Polybius,</hi> and our own conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; for <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſpeaks but very little of it, and that little is in very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms. But for the Fortification of the Camp, we are more obliged to <hi>Vegetius</hi> than <hi>Polybius.</hi> The firſt ſpends five full Chapters on Encamping, to wit, the twenty firſt, twenty ſecond, twenty third, twenty fourth and twenty fifth of his firſt Book; and either for fear that he had forgot ſomething in all theſe Chapters, or elſe, according to his cuſtome, to refreſh his own or our memories, he falls again to his Caſtrametation in the eighth Chapter of his third Book. The ſumm of all he ſaith on that Subject will amount to this:<note place="margin">Summ of what <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſaith of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrametation.</note> 
                     <q rend="inline">He laments that in his time, the ancient cuſtome of fortifying Camps was worn out, for want whereof, ſays he, we have known many <hi>Roman</hi> Armies afflicted by the ſudden incurſions of the barbarous Nations: Beſides, ſaith he, if they be worſted in any Battel, having no Camp to retire to, they fall by the edge of the Sword unrevenged, like brutes; neither doth the Enemy make an end of killing them, till he is weary of purſuing them. He ſays, The Army is to Encamp where it may have ſtore of Fuel, Wood, Water and Fodder, where the air is wholſome, and free from Mariſhes; and if it be to ſtay any time, it muſt be well looked to, that no Hill be near, from whence an Enemy may infeſt it, and that the place be not ſubject to inundations of Waters. The Camp is to be of ſuch an extent, that neither Men, Beaſts, nor Baggage, be pinched for want of room; nor muſt it be ſo large, but that the Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it in all its circumference, may be ſufficiently defended by the men that are within it.</q> This is all he ſays of Caſtrametation. As to the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the Camp, he tells us one and the ſame thing of it, in the twenty fourth Chapter of his firſt Book, and in the eighth Chapter of his third Book,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97406:72"/> and it is ſhortly this: <q rend="inline">That there were three ſeveral ſorts or ways of fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Camp: Firſt, if there was but little danger, the Rampart ſhould be made but three foot high<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (ſuppoſe above the line) and this Rampart was to be made of Turf cut out of the place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the Ditch ſhould be, and the<note place="margin">And of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Camp.</note> looſe earth of the ſame, the which Ditch ſhould be nine foot broad, and ſeven deep; and this was called <hi>Foſſa tumultuaria,</hi> or a Ditch ſuddenly caſt up, and it ſeems was uſed when the Army was to ſtay but a night or two, and no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my near it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far <hi>Vegetius</hi> is clear, but in deſcribing the other two ways of fortifying, he is extreamly confuſed, both in his firſt and third Book. But if I gueſs right at his meaning, he intends to tell us that the ſecond way of fortification was when an imminent danger of an enemy appeared, then the Ditch was nine foot deep, and twelve broad, and the Ramp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d thirdly, when they found themſelves in the greateſt hazard, the Rampart was planted about with theſe Stakes and Paliſado<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s, which the Soldiers were oblige<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to carry about with them. So that reckoning from the top of the Rampart to the bottom of the Ditch, it was thirteen foot high, and the Ditch it ſelf twelve foot broad. I would he had ſaid either eleven or thirteen, for then he had not contradicted himſelf, for he told us before that in Fortification the <hi>Romans</hi> were accuſtom'd to obſerve an odd number. The Turf whereof the Rampart was made, uſed to be half a foot deep, one foot broad, and one foot and a half long.</p>
                  <p>Thus far <hi>Vegetius</hi> concerning the Fortification of the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp.</p>
                  <p>But that which he adds in the eighth Chapter of his Third Book, is not to be omitted, That all Generals who Encamp their Armies for any time, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did frequently whole Summers, and whole Winters, (the firſt whereof were called <hi>Aeſtiva,</hi> and the laſt <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Below the Tents of the Tribunes there was a Street which traverſed the<note place="margin">Inferior part of the Camp.</note> whole breadth of the Camp, and divided the ſuperior part of it from that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior one which I am now to deſcribe. This Street was a hundred foot broad, and was called <hi>Via Principalis,</hi> the principal Street; whether it had that name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">Via Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palis.</note> it was near the Conſuls Pavilion, the Tribunes Tents, and the Eagles; or becauſe if the Camp was of any long continuance, they erected their Altars in that Street is no great matter. This Street was interſected by another, which did run the whole length of the Camp, from the <hi>Decuman Port,</hi> to the <hi>Praeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> one. This Lane divided the right hand <hi>Roman</hi> Legion from the left hand one, and conſequently had on each ſide of it the half of the Conſular Army. On the right ſide of it were quartered the Horſe and Foot belonging to the firſt <hi>Roman</hi> Legion, and on the right hand of that Legion the firſt Legion of the Allies in this following order.</p>
                  <p>Neareſt to the Street was quartered the Cavalry belonging to the firſt Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Quarters for the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe of the firſt Legion.</note> all in one Row or Street; call it as you pleaſe, for <hi>Polybius</hi> his Interpreter uſeth both <hi>Striga</hi> and <hi>Vicus,</hi> a Row and a Street. This Row was divided into ten ſeveral quarters, each of which was to contain and lodge a Troop conſiſting of thirty Riders, with their Horſes, Arms and Baggage. Every one of theſe ten Quarters was a hundred foot ſquare, and conſequently the whole Row was a thouſand foot long, and a hundred foot broad. If you pleaſe to multiply a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by a hundred, you will find the product ten thouſand Foot, and ſo much ground had every Troop of thirty Horſe allowed to it. And that I may tell it you once for all, every Maniple of the <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Haſtati</hi> had as much, but not the <hi>Triarii,</hi> as you will ſee anon.

                  <p>You will remember that in my Diſcourſe of the Allies I told you that the third part of their Horſe, and fifth part of their Foot were taken out to wait on the Conſul, and were called <hi>Extraordinaries,</hi> whom accordingly I have quartered in the upper part of the Camp near the Conſul. Their Horſe at firſt were ſix hundred for every Legion, whereof two hundred being lodged in the upper part, we have but four hundred to quarter in the lower part of the Camp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe being by one third ſtronger than the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry, had of ground a<note place="margin">Horſe of the Allies firſt Legion lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</note> third more in breadth allowed, but alike length; the quarter then for the Horſe of the firſt Legion of the Allies was a thouſand foot in length, and 13<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I muſt tell you of an overſight I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in my Lord <hi>Preiſſack's Roman</hi> Caſtrametation, which is, that he allows to the Allies Foot as much ground as I have done now, but no more ground to their Horſe than to the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry, which was not fair, being the one was ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by one third than the other. It is of little or no conſequence to us to know, nor is it worth our curioſity whether the Allies quarter'd their Foot by Maniples, or by Cohorts, concerning which <hi>Lipſius</hi> to me ſeems to be very needleſly ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous.

                  <p>You may remember that the length of our Camp was calculated to be two<note place="margin">

It is true the odds is not great, yet ſuch as makes its figure not to be perfectly aequilateral ſquare, which is the figure ſo much contended for. But <hi>Terduzzi</hi> ſays that here a rigorous ſtrictneſs in the meaſure is not to be look'd to, things being done, ſays he, in a Martial not a Geometrical field. But I am of opinion that no meaſure ſhould be more, ſtrictly obſerved than that of ground allowed for Encamping, for if it be not, you ſhall hardly ſhun ſtrife and altercation, and which is worſe, diſorder and confuſion.</p>
                  <p>Now let us ſee if you pleaſe, how much ground this Conſular Camp<note place="margin">Superficial meaſure of the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp.</note> contained, or (which is all one) what was the ſuperficial meaſure of it. This you may do, by multiplying the length by the breadth, to wit, two thouſand and fifty, by two thouſand and ſeventeen, the product will be (if I have caſt it up right) 4134850; divide this number by five, to make paces of it, the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient will be 826970, and this will want only thirty paces of eight hundred and twenty ſeven <hi>Italian</hi> miles.</p>

                  <p>I know not how they ſhall be reconciled in theſe points, and eſpecially in the laſt: For upon the one hand, I think it agrees with reaſon, that the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Port ſhould have been neareſt the Enemy, as out of which the Army was to march in queſt of that Enemy; and no doubt, the Conſul would chuſe to lodge as near the Enemy as he could, and on the head of that Army of his own, which faced conſtantly towards the Enemy, ſince he did not quarter in the middle of his Army. And conform to this, we find the fronts of<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſons for <hi>Lipſius.</hi>
                     </note> the ſeveral quarters of both Horſe and Foot, that were lodged in the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour part of the Camp, to face all towards the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> and <hi>Via Principalis,</hi> on the other ſide whereof were the Tribunes quartered. Neither doth it ſeem reaſonable, that the Conſul, and his Tribunes quartered in the Rear of the Camp, for ſo they muſt have done, if they had lodged ſo far from the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Port, out of which the Army was to march. And all this makes for <hi>Lipſius</hi> his poſition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp: Yet I muſt tell you, that on the other hand, I think <hi>Steuechius</hi> may not only alledge his own Author <hi>Vegetius</hi> to be for him, but <hi>Polybius</hi> likewiſe. Let us hear them both, I ſhall <hi>Engliſh</hi> them faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. <hi>Vegetius</hi> in the twenty third Chapter of his firſt Book ſays, <q rend="inline">The <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuman</hi> Port is behind the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> out of which the delinquent Souldiers are carried to their puniſhment.</q> Behind the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> that is not far from<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſons for <hi>Steuechius.</hi>
                     </note> it. And this inſinuates, that the aſpect of the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> or Conſuls Pavilion, was towards the furtheſt end of the Camp, where <hi>Steuechius</hi> will have the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian</hi> Port to be. For if <hi>Vegetius</hi> had meant, that the further end of the lower part of the Camp was the place where the <hi>Decuman</hi> Port was, he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not have ſaid it was behind the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> but behind all the quarters of the Legions, as <hi>Lipſius</hi> makes it to be. And <hi>Polybius</hi> in his ſixth Book, ſpeaking of that nameleſs ſtreet which traverſeth the upper region of the Camp, hath theſe words, and I pray obſerve them. <q>Over againſt the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> ſaith he, there is a ſtreet, which carrieth to the Poſtern parts of the Camp.</q> Here he ſeems to be very clear for <hi>Steuechius;</hi> if he be not, hear him once more: He had been ſpeaking of the extraordinary Horſe of the Allies, and he adds theſe words: <q>Averſe from theſe Horſes, are quarter'd the Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Foot of the Allies, looking to the back of the Camp.</q> Now theſe Extraordinaries were quarter'd in the upper part of the Camp, and not far from the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> and faced to the Rampart; which by this place of <hi>Polybius</hi> was the back of the Camp; and conſequently the Port neareſt it, was the <hi>Decuman.</hi> I ſhall leave it to thoſe who underſtand Caſtrametation better than I either do, or profeſs to do, to compoſe the difference.</p>

By this account, three Tents ſerv'd all the Horſe-men of one Troop, and twelve ſerv'd a Maniple of Foot of one hundred and twenty Men. I find their Tents were made of Leather, for holding out of rain, and were carried at the publick charges. <hi>Terduzzi</hi> ſays they were low and flat, and he calls them in his <hi>Italian</hi> language, <hi>Trabacche;</hi> which is, Booths or Shelters. In this place <hi>Lipſius</hi> offers to fill up a corner of their Tent with a <hi>Vas,</hi> ſo he calls it; a Veſſel, or a Tub, (and indeed it is but the tale of a Tub, to ſay no worſe of it) wherein he will have the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers to do the work of nature: He ſays, it is but his own conjecture, and truly, it is ſo poor a one, that he might have kept it to himſelf, and the Tub too. For who will imagine, except <hi>Lipſius,</hi> that the Contubernals did make one of theſe Veſſels at every nights Leaguer, or elſe that they carried it about with them by turns?

                  <p>The ſame <hi>Lipſius,</hi> and to ſecond him <hi>Terduzzi,</hi> are very prolix in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the regularity, form, conveniency, and order of this Camp; of which a man is oblig'd to believe no more, than what agreeth with his own reaſon.

And I pray you obſerve, that but juſt now <hi>Terduzzi</hi> aſſur'd us, that within the Camp was quarter'd the Conſular Army of ſixteen thouſand eight hundred Foot, and eighteen hundred Horſe, and of that number he now ſends four thouſand eight hundred out of the Camp, for want of quarter within it, not to come back till time of danger: His own words are, <hi>Ricevendoli dentro, ſolo in tempo di pericolo;</hi> Receiving them within, ſays he, only in time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Here I am either miſtaken; or <hi>Terduzzi,</hi> beſides the improbability of his conjecture, foully contradicts himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee the poor <hi>Velites</hi> very ill uſed; for if you will remember what<note place="margin">Velites Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidua Vaga.</note> I have obſerved of them in the preceding Chapters and in this, you will think with me, that they were marſhall'd and fought I know not how, they marched I know not when, and they were quarter'd I know not where. I ſhall not imagine for all that, that they were Spirits, but I think, it may be diſputed Problematical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether they were <hi>Individua Vaga,</hi> or not. And ſo I take my leave of them.</p>

And within that vaſt Leaguer, was an inward one, conſiſting of the <hi>Levites,</hi> who encamped alſo <hi>en Carree,</hi> facing Eaſt, South, Weſt, and North. Theſe were the Guards of the Lords Ark. Yet being that the Sacred Text tells us, that all theſe Tribes were not of equal ſtrength and number, it muſt follow, that thoſe who were moſt numerous, had moſt ground allowed them, and conſequently more rows of Tents, and more room for their Beaſts and Baggage, and therefore the form of the whole Camp could not be Square, but oblong. And here I ſhall alſo ſay, that the manner of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Encamping and Caſtrametation did more reſemble our form (whereof we ſhall ſpeak in its proper place) than the <hi>Roman,</hi> for we find the Ark of God (who was the Conductor, and Great General of that Army) lodged in the Center and middle of the whole Camp: About it, the <hi>Levites</hi> (who were honoured to be its Guards) and without them, and about them the other Tribes, as they were marſhalled by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the man of God. And as they were Encamped, ſo we read they Marched: Firſt, the Enſign of <hi>Judah,</hi> and under it three Tribes: Next, the Enſign of <hi>Reuben,</hi> and under it three Tribes: After them, marched the <hi>Levites</hi> in the middle of the Army, and in the center of them the Ark: After them came the Enſign of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> under which were three Tribes; and in the laſt place marched the Enſign of <hi>Dan,</hi> and under it three Tribes.</p>

                  <p>IF this Camp, though never ſo ſtrongly fortified, be not carefully guarded, it will be but a prey to a reſolute Enemy. Both the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Grecjan</hi> Guards were, as ours are, of both Horſe and Foot; the difference is this, they had ſeveral Guards for the day and the night, ours continue twenty four hours, unleſs ſome emergency alter the cuſtome. You have the <hi>Roman</hi> Guards expreſſed by three ſeveral words common in Authors, and though all three ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified Guards in ſome ſenſe, yet if I miſtake not (with ſubmiſſion to others) theſe three ſeveral words ſignified three ſeveral things. <hi>Excubi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Whether their Horſe-guards ſtood conſtantly, their Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders being on Horſe-back, Authors make it not clear: I ſuppoſe it was only the Sentinels, yet probably it was otherwiſe: And becauſe it was an extream fatigue either in the heat of Summer or cold of Winter, we read in <hi>Lavy</hi>'s 45 Book, that the Conſul <hi>Lucius Aemili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s</hi> in the <hi>Macedonian</hi> War, order'd the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards to be relieved at noon; ſo the day from ſix in the morning till ſix at night, was equally divided by two ſeveral guards of Horſe: I know not whether the Foot-Guards were alſo changed, it ſeems not; elſe the Hiſtorian had menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned it; and if not, that Conſul hath had a more tender regard to Horſe than Men. The Military word <hi>Station,</hi> hath ſince been appropriated to all other profeſſions, yea, and to all other Trades, be they never ſo mechanick and low; yea, to all Magiſtrates and Office-bearers, how high ſoever, even to him who is veſted with the Soveraign and Supreme Power: So that every man in his Station, is a word now proper enough.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients kept Guards both without and within their Camps: Within,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Roman</hi> Guards within the Camp.</note> the <hi>Romans</hi> order'd a Maniple to watch at the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> or Conſuls quarters, day and night. Three <hi>Quaternions</hi> of Souldiers watched at the Treaſury, two at the Legates quarters, and two for every Tribune, and one was appointed to look to the quarters of every Maniple; all theſe were of the <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Haſtati,</hi> for the <hi>Triarii</hi> kept Guards at the Horſe-quarters. Every hundred foot of the Rampart had a Quaternion of Souldiers to guard it. The reaſon why theſe Guards were called Quaternions, was, becauſe each of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of four Souldiers, that were ordered for one Sentinel, which they kept by turns. We find theſe Military terms of the <hi>Romans</hi> uſed by the Pen-men of the New Teſtament; In the twelfth Chapter of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>Herod</hi> delivered St. <hi>Peter</hi> to be guarded by four Quaternions of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97406:78"/> Souldiers, that is, to four Guards, each compoſed of four Souldiers, every one of which Quaternions or Guards, was to keep a Centinel upon him. The Quaternio, or the four Soldiers was to watch full twelve hours, every one of<note place="margin">A Quaterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what.</note> them a Vigil, to wit, three hours; and it is to be preſumed, one of them ſtood Centinel one whole Vigil, becauſe they could not well by their Glaſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a Vigil of three hours into four ſeveral parts; and truly that was too long, for in four hours time a Centinel might very readily have been both weary and ſleepy.</p>
                  <p>For any thing I yet know, the Guards without the Camp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were only kept in<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Roman</hi> Guards without their Camp.</note> the day time, and before every Port of it a Cohort of Foot, and a Troop of Horſe watched; but when an enemy was near, their Stations or Guards were doubled, tripled, or quadrupled, according as the danger ſeem'd to require. This ſaith <hi>Terduzzi</hi> was an eaſie duty, becauſe, ſays he, there were forty Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, and forty Troops in the four Legions, and therefore he thinks they watched but every tenth night. But he did not conſider how many Guards were<note place="margin">Miſtake of <hi>Terduzzi.</hi>
                     </note> kept within the Leaguer, for if he had, he might have concluded that the Foot ordinarily watched every fourth night; and when the Guards were doubled, or tripled, the Duty would come upon them every ſecond, if not every other day. The Conſul or General appointed the Stations or places where Guards ſhould be kept without the Camp, which in reaſon ought to have been ſo order'd that they might have had ſuccours according to the neceſſity or exigence of affairs, and therefore you may find that <hi>Caeſar</hi> when he cauſed his Guards to advance nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the enemy, and further from his own Camp, he ſtill commanded freſh Troops and Cohorts to be brought out to fill up their room, and to ſupport and ſuſtain thoſe who were advanc'd in caſe of a retreat. <hi>Livy</hi> tells us in his Thirteenth Book, that <hi>Manlius</hi> was accuſed at <hi>Rome</hi> by the Tribunes of the people for keeping weak Guards without his Leaguer, and that they attributed the loſs of both Camp and Army to that.</p>
                  <p>It was death for any man of what degree or quality ſo ever to deſert or leave his ſtation, let the pretext be never ſo plauſible or advantageous. <hi>Livy</hi> in his<note place="margin">Deſertion of a Station, death.</note> Fourth Book ſays that he read it in the <hi>Roman</hi> Annals, that the Dictator <hi>Poſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> put his own Son <hi>Aulus Poſthumius</hi> to death for advancing beyond his ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though thereby he gain'd an advantage of the enemy. And though that Author writes that he did not believe it, yet it may be true for all that. <hi>Lipſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>s</hi> commends much the <hi>Roman</hi> cuſtom of having four Soldiers on one Poſt, and for not committing the keeping of it to one Centinel, as the manner is now to have but one man at every Port of a Town. But this Bookiſh man was ſo much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with the Theory of the ancient Militia, that he ſtudied but little the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice<note place="margin">Miſtake of <hi>Lipſius</hi> of the Modern Guards.</note> of the Modern; for I dare be bound for it, that in the Country where he lived he never ſaw a Centinel at a Port of a Town, but where there was a <hi>Corps du guard</hi> cloſe by of more than four Soldiers, though they were not oblig'd to ſtand all Centinel at one time more than the <hi>Roman Quaternio</hi> was, whereof only one ſtood. But the old Tactick <hi>Aeneas</hi> will not have Centinels to ſtand ſingle,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Grecian</hi> Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels.</note> but two or more together, and to ſtand but a very ſhort time, for which he gives two reaſons, firſt, for fear that being long on duty they might fall aſleep; ſecondly, that they might have no time to practiſe with an enemy, but frequent rounds and viſits of the Corporals might prevent both theſe.</p>

Yet I believe the Rounds found but few ſleeping, for they had fires allow'd them, by the light whereof they might diſcern both an enemy and a Round, and one Guard was almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly calling to another to keep them awake: beſides, it is not likely that all the other three of the Quaternion were aſleep; and if any one of them were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97406:79"/> it is not probable he would ſuffer his fellow Centinel to be taken ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And in proceſs of time they follow'd the example of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and uſed Bells, by which one Guard correſponded and anſwer'd another; for <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> tells us, that of all Nations the <hi>Romans</hi> were the apteſt to learn and imitate the commendable cuſtoms of others. Next morning very betimes, the Roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders went and gave the Tribunes an account of their diligence; and where they found a <hi>Teſſera</hi> wanting, either by the ſleep, negligence or deſertion of any of the Guards or Centinels; the Delinquent if apprehended, was puniſhed by the<note place="margin">Grievouſly puniſhed.</note>

He would have all Rounds or <hi>Circitors</hi> to ride where Horſes might conveniently be had, but no Round either to go or ride till he were commanded ſo to do by his Superior, either by word of mouth, or ſome ſign, ſuppoſe a fire or a Lanthorn. He will have all his Rounds to give the word to the Guards, and not to receive it from them, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did their <hi>Teſſera,</hi> which indeed ſeems to be the ſurer way; but his Rounds he permits not to give the Watch-word till the Guards require it. And in time of danger he will have the Guards when they require the word from the Rounds (if it be in the night-time) to utter ſome words or ſounds (ſuch as have been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by the General or Governour of the place) and the Rounds beſides the giving the Watch word, to utter ſuch counter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But if it be in the day-time, (obſerve by this, that Rounds rode in the day, at leaſt in the morning) then the Guards when they asked the word, were to give ſigns, and the Rounds counter ſigns ſuch as were condeſcended on by him who commanded in chief on the place. As ſuppoſe when one of the Guards required the word from the Round, he would put his Hat or his Head-piece on his face, breaſt, or belly, and upon that ſign the Round was to advance, or order his Lance or Spear as a counter-ſign.</p>

                  <p>In all publick Wars that ever were, Priſoners have been taken, over whom the Victor always aſſum'd to himſelf power of life and death. And I believe for<note place="margin">Reaſon why Priſoners are taken in War.</note> moſt part, the lives of Priſoners were ſaved, not ſo much out of pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, as out of intereſt, thereby to draw advantages either by exchanging them for others who had fallen into that ſame miſery, or by ranſoming them for money, or to make profit of them by Drudgery and Slavery.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:97406:79"/> the thirteenth they rebelled.</hi> Sure then before theſe twelve years they were free people, and that which made them Vaſſals was the longeſt and ſharpeſt ſword. And when <hi>Abraham</hi> reſcued <hi>Lot,</hi> and his goods, the women alſo, and the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is no doubt but he took ſome Priſoners of <hi>Chaderlaomer</hi> his party, which he had beaten, elſe the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> had not ſaid to him, <hi>Give me the perſons, and take the goods to thy ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Law of Nations is that which all or moſt Nations agree in, either by a<note place="margin">The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of War.</note> mutual, declared, or yet by a tacite aſſent. And therefore we may truly ſay that by the Law of Nations before Chriſtianity ſhone over the World, Priſoners of War might be uſed as the Victor pleaſed, that is, either made ſlaves, or put to death. In this Diſcourſe I ſhall only ſpeak how the Ancients uſed their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and of their Parleys, Treaties, and Articles before the Promulgation of the Goſpel, reſerving the Diſcourſe of Chriſtian Priſoners till towards the end of my Eſſays of the Modern Art of War.</p>
                  <p>We are told by <hi>Xenophon,</hi> that after the Great <hi>Cyrus</hi> had taken <hi>Babylon,</hi> he told his Captains that it was a perpetual Law through the whole World that<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cyrus</hi> his ſenſe of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</note> thoſe who ſtood out in arms till they were overcome, might be diſpoſed of, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to their eſtates and goods, or their lives and perſons, at the Victors plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And if you will conſider all the Wars that were managed either before or after his time, you will find he ſpoke truth; for if it was not a perpetual Law, it was a perpetual cuſtom to do all that he ſaid. This ſpeech of his was confirmed by the <hi>Athenian</hi> Embaſſadors, whom <hi>Thucydides</hi> introduceth, telling the Inhabitants of <hi>Melus</hi> (whom they had beſieged both by Sea and Land), <q rend="inline">That Nature her ſelf had put a neceſſity on all Conquerours and Victors in War to have the abſolute dominion and power over thoſe who were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed<note place="margin">The <hi>At<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> to be diſpoſed of as the Victors pleaſed; which Law, ſaid they, we did not make, nor are we the firſt who have made uſe of it, neither will we hinder it to be a perpetual Law to ages to come, being aſſuredly confident, ſaid they, that if you had that power over us, that we probably may ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have over you, you would not fail to put this Law in execution againſt us.</q> So you ſee that both <hi>Cyrus</hi> and the <hi>Athenians</hi> thought Priſoners of War might be put to death if the Victor pleaſed, not only by the Law of War, but by the Law of both Nations and Nature.</p>
                  <p>Before I go further, I ſhall premiſe one thing, at which perhaps many of my own Profeſſion ſcruple, which is that notwithſtanding any quarter granted in the field in time of Battel or skirmiſh, or at the aſſaults of Towns or Caſtles,<note place="margin">How a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral may uſe his Priſoners of War, <hi>Jur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> he who commands in chief over the Victorious army may put all or any of the Priſoners to death that he pleaſeth, without doing any wrong to the Law of War, becauſe they had no quarter promiſed them by him either by word, or in writing, which we ordinarily call Parol. What quarter is given by any Officer who is inferior for the time, or by any Soldier, is but till the General or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief judg of the Priſoners, and then he may do with them as he pleaſeth. But obſerve on the other hand, that though <hi>Jure Belli</hi> he may do ſo, yet when he puts Priſoners to death in cold blood, he may be juſtly branded with inhumanity and cruelty, unleſs thoſe Priſoners have been Traytors, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, Runaways, or Fugitives, or that Quarter had been promiſed contrary to the expreſs command of the General; any of theſe alters the caſe. Such was that act of <hi>Saul</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who gave quarter to <hi>Agag,</hi> contrary to the expreſs command of the Lord of Hoſts, who had ordained him to die.</p>
                  <p>Let us take a ſhort view how this perpetual Law, whereof <hi>Cyrus</hi> and the <hi>Athenian</hi> Embaſſadors ſpoke, was executed in ancient times; and I believe we ſhall ſee that all Priſoners of War were either ranſom'd, exchang'd, put to death, or made ſlaves.

In one of my Diſcourſes of the Modern Art of War, I ſhall ſpeak more fully of the ſad effects of negligence in time of Parleys and Treaties. Some of the Ancient <hi>Gauls</hi> were in Treaty with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and had a Ceſſation of Arms with him, they perfidiouſly break it, and kill many of his people; he marches againſt them, they ſend Embaſſadours to him, without any previous liberty demanded, or granted by him for thoſe Embaſſadours, and therefore he keeps them in reſtraint, till he had utterly undone their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: Here they broke with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> not <hi>Caeſar</hi> with them, for after their breach, he neither granted them Treaty nor Ceſſation, nor Paſsports for their Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours; yet <hi>Cato,</hi> in full Senate, avouched this act of his to be Perfidy, and a<note place="margin">

                  <p>The Ancient <hi>Greeks,</hi> who accounted all other Nations <hi>Barbarians,</hi> broke frequently their Treaties, Conventions, and Articles very barbarouſly. Thoſe who commanded the <hi>Corcyrian</hi> Army articled with the Inhabitants of <hi>Epidam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that they ſhould deliver up their Town, and that till the pleaſure of the populace of <hi>Corcyra</hi> were known, all the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſhould be kept in Chains, and all ſtrangers ſold for Slaves: A bad enough agreement at beſt, and yet the half of it was but kept by the <hi>Corcyrians,</hi> for all the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were indeed<note place="margin">Articles broke.</note> kept in Fetters, but the ſtrangers were all put to death. In that total rout gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>Athenians</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Sicily,</hi> by the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> aſſiſted by <hi>Gilippus</hi> a <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Captain, <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> one of the Generals for <hi>Athens,</hi> had Articles granted him for his own life, and ſix thouſand men that were with him, and ſo they yielded themſelves Priſoners; and ſhortly after <hi>Nicias,</hi> the other <hi>Athenian</hi> General, ſubmitted himſelf without conditions, to <hi>Gilippus</hi> his diſcretion: Both of them were put to death. And though no Articles were<note place="margin">Perfidious and cruel uſage.</note> broke to <hi>Nicias,</hi> yet it was inhumanity to kill him in cold blood; but in the death of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> Perfidy was added to Cruelty. The bloody Dictator <hi>Sylla</hi> made Articles with three thouſand <hi>Romans</hi> at <hi>Antenna,</hi> and gave them their lives, on condition that they ſhould kill ſome of their own party within the Town, who were his Enemies: They performed their part, but ſo did not he, for he put them all to the Sword; a perfidious act of his part, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they met with that which they well deſerved.</p>
                  <p>Treaties ought to be concluded, and Agreements and Articles ſubſcribed, without any deſign to pick quarrels, or to lay hold on any ſmall emergent<note place="margin">No quarrel to be pick'd out of Articles.</note> that may ſeem to give the contracting parties any ombrage or occaſion of breaking: This hath been too often practiſed in our Modern Wars, nor did ſome of the Ancients fail to help themſelves with baſe fetches. Take two or three inſtances: At <hi>Pilos,</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> are beaten at Sea by the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and four hundred of them ſhut up in a barren Iſland, likely to be ſtarved: An agreement is made, the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> are to deliver up their Ships, a final Peace is to be concluded, and thoſe in the Iſland were to be ſet at liberty, but if any one Article happened to be infringed, then all of them were to be void; and if the people of <hi>Athens</hi> (who had the Soveraignty) did not ratifie this agreement, the Truce was to end, the war to begin, and all the<note place="margin">Thucydides.</note> Gallies were to be reſtored. The <hi>Athenian</hi> State rejects the Treaty, the Ceſſation is given up, the War is commenced, but the Fleet was not reſtored, becauſe, ſaid the <hi>Athenian</hi> Captains, in time of the Truce, ſome of the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> endeavour'd to get out of the barren Iſle into <hi>Pilos:</hi> A moſt deteſtable Perfidy. And what better was the uſage the <hi>Samnites</hi> got from the <hi>Romans</hi> in that Treaty, wherein they gave the <hi>Roman</hi> Army liberty to depart<note place="margin">Livius.</note> and go home, after they had made every man of them paſs under the Gallows at <hi>Caudium?</hi> the Senate refuſed to ratifie the Treaty, prepared for War, and ſent the Conſuls who had ſign'd the Articles, priſoners to the <hi>Samnites;</hi> a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge which did not quadrate with the Juſtice to which they pretended. Yet
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97406:82"/> it was ſuch uſage as was foretold to the <hi>Samnites</hi> by their old General <hi>Herennius.</hi> A conſiderable number of <hi>Corcyrians</hi> (who ſeditiouſly had left the Town, taken arms and ſpoil'd the adjacent Country) are routed by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> they come to a Parley, and it is agreed firſt they ſhould deliver up all their Arms: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all their Auxiliaries: and thirdly they ſhould remain faithful Priſoners till the people of <hi>Athens</hi> gave judgment, what ſhould be done with them, but ſtill provided they ſhould not be deliver'd to their mercileſs Countrymen the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyrians;</hi>

                     </note> but this was the <hi>Athenians</hi> grand deſign, and therefore an article is ſhuffled in, that if any one of theſe conditions were broke, all of them ſhould be void. Then were ſome <hi>Corcyrians</hi> ſent to the Priſoners, who counterfeiting themſelves friends, adviſe them to eſcape, and to that purpoſe offer them a Ship; the infatuated people lays hold on the offer, and ſails away, but being way-laid, are eaſily retaken, and then delivered to their capital enemies, who put them all to cruel deaths. An execrable act of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and that the rather becauſe their City was famous for Schools, wherein were taught the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vertues. I will not ſpeak here of <hi>Hannibals</hi> breaking <hi>Maharbals</hi> Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with ſix thouſand <hi>Romans</hi> at <hi>Thraſimenus,</hi> but ſhall reſerve it till I ſpeak of the power that ſubordinate Officers have to give Conditions and Articles, which you may find in the Twenty ſixth Chapter of the <hi>Modern Art of War.</hi>

Sure if they had thought they had been in that danger, they had never ſign'd a paper tending ſo directly to their own deſtruction; and therefore that Article was ſign'd againſt the intention of the Capitulators, and ſo perhaps was void in Law. <hi>Amilcar</hi> made alſo choice of the Ten himſelf, and not the Senate which was againſt the Letter of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation.

This treachery in ſeeking and laying hold on occaſion to break Treaties and Articles was, is, and ever will be a monſtrous crime crying to Heaven for vengeance. The Sons of <hi>Saul</hi> paid dear for their fathers breach to the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> who with mouldy bread and<note place="margin">

But theſe very reaſons which made his parley with them juſtifiable, render'd their meeting with him, in preſence of the Soldiers of both Armies (which <hi>Caeſar</hi> would needs have) altogether inexcuſable. And indeed <hi>Pompey</hi> refuſed on good grounds all parley with <hi>Caeſar</hi> at <hi>Dirrachium.</hi> But there was no ſuch cauſe of <hi>Caeſars</hi> Perſonal parley with <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> King of <hi>Germany,</hi> at which I ſuppoſe he was made ſenſible of his error; for though he thought he had made the meeting cock-ſure, on a little hill ſituated in the midſt of a large

                  <p>AS in all well order'd Commonwealths the Vertuous ſhould be cheriſhed, and the wicked chaſtiſed, ſo in Armies, (which both in Oeconomy and Policy, do not only repreſent, but are indeed either well or ill govern'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks) thoſe who in ancient times did ſignal ſervices, were rewarded, and thoſe who tranſgreſſed Military Laws were puniſhed.

                  </p>
                  <p>That which <hi>Lamachus</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays is now common, <hi>Non licet bis in bello peccare.</hi> In War one cannot do wrong twice; that is, <hi>in ſumma rei,</hi> in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal points of War; as in the loſs of an army, the ill Marſhalling of it, the ill fighting a Battel, the loſs of a conſiderable Town or Paſs, by negligence, ſloth, treachery, or cowardiſe. <hi>Vegetius</hi> in the Thirteenth Chapter of his firſt Book, ſays, <hi>Praliorum delicta emendationem non recipiunt.</hi> The errors committed in fighting Battels are not capable of amendment. And in the fifth Chapter of his Third Book he tells us, <hi>Siquidem nulla ſit negligentia venia, ubi de ſalute certa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">There is no pardon for a neglect, where men fight for the common ſafety.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now though it be an unqueſtionable truth, that when ſubjects do their Prince and Country ſervice, they do but their duty; and when they do either of them diſſervice, or tranſgreſs Laws, they deſerve puniſhment: yet it is as true, that men naturally are much encouraged to vertue, by ſeeing rewards liberally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd on thoſe who are faithful and loyal, as they are frighted or terrified from vice by the puniſhments they ſee inflicted on the wicked and diſloyal. I think it was no flaſh, but a remarkable ſaying of a Noble <hi>Engliſh</hi> General, who by an<note place="margin">Rewards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage as well as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> exemplary hanging of ſome Plunderers in his Army, did encourage the Country Gentlemen to intreat him to hang ſome more for taking Geeſe and Hens, and yet they were making no great haſte to bring in either meat or money for the entertainment of the Army: Nay, Gentlemen, (ſaid the General) all hanging, and no money will not keep any Army together, a little hanging, and a little money will do better. And indeed it is ſo, all puniſhment, and no reward, proves but one ſupport, inſtead of two to the continuance of either Commonwealth or Armies.</p>
                  <p>Many of the ancient Governours of Republicks, and Commanders of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies knew very well how to diſpence both rewards and puniſhments. Some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whom both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> qualified with the title of Barbarous, were
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97406:84"/> extreamly inhumane in their puniſhments. So we read that he who came laſt to<note place="margin">Some ancient Nations inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane in their puniſhments.</note> the Rendezvouz of the ancient <hi>Gauls,</hi> was either cut in pieces, or thrown quick into a fire. And <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his Seventh Book of the <hi>Gallick</hi> War, ſays, that for petty faults, <hi>Vercengent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Though the <hi>Grecians</hi> were ſevere in their puniſhments, yet we find them not ordinarily cruel in them, their Animadverſions being for moſt part rather Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious than Capital. It is ſaid of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> (from whom others had their breeding in the Military Art) that they puniſht a Coward by clothing him in a Womans apparel, and making him ſtand every third day in their Markets, or other publick places, which was lookt on by men of ſpirit as worſe than death. We find the ordinary death to which the <hi>Grecian</hi> Delinquents in Armies<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Grecian</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</note> were put, was that of ſtoning, which perhaps they learned from a more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent people than themſelves, the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> it being a cuſtom with them to take their Malefactors without the Camp, and there ſtone them to death. This pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was no new invented one in the time of <hi>Alexander,</hi> for <hi>Q.

Puniſhments of another ſort were inflicted by the Great <hi>Alexander,</hi> after his great Soul began to deviate from the path of Vertue; ſuch was his inhumane torturing to death the noble <hi>Phil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> to be murthered, whoſe Conduct had ſo much contributed to moſt of his Conqueſts.</p>
                  <p>I much wonder why <hi>Steuechius</hi> will reckon ſtoning to be a <hi>Roman</hi> puniſhment, for we find nothing of it ſo far as I know in Hiſtory. He tells us, as he ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of <hi>Florus;</hi> he might have ſaid out of <hi>Livius</hi> too, that <hi>Poſthumius</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral was kill'd with ſtones by his own Soldiers. But that which was done by a Mutinous Army to their Commander in chief, is not to be reckoned a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment authorized by Law, for he confeſſeth it was done in a Mutiny, <hi>Seditione facta.</hi> I have ſpoken of this Mutiny in another place.</p>
                  <p>What puniſhments were legally inflicted on the <hi>Roman</hi> Officers and Soldiers,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Roman</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</note> we are left to glean out of Hiſtory, for <hi>Polybius</hi> ſpeaks but of few, and <hi>Vegetius</hi> of none that I remember, except in the Fourteenth Chapter of his firſt Book, where he ſaith, the <hi>Tirones</hi> who either did not willingly learn their Exerciſes, or made no great proficiency in them, were fed with Barley inſtead of Wheat. But we find that manner of puniſhment impoſed on the <hi>Veterans</hi> as well as the <hi>Novitiates,</hi> and for other faults. <hi>Livy</hi> in his Thirty ſeventh Book, ſays, that ſome Companies who had loſt their Colours were appointed to be fed with<note place="margin">Feeding with Barley.</note> Barley. <hi>Polybius</hi> tells us that the Tribunes had power to Fine, to take Pledges, and to whip with Rods; and a Centurion had power to whip with Vines, for a twig of a Vine was his Badg, whereby he was known. <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſays, that one <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius</hi> a Centurion was nick nam'd, <hi>Cad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Deſertion of a Poſt was death, but the puniſhment I laſt ſpoke of was worſe than death. By their Law it was death to leave their Officers or Colours in the Field; to loſe Arms, or go from their Guards, to commit theft, to bear falſe<note place="margin">Crimes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht alike by death.</note> witneſs, or commit any one crime, how ſmall ſo ever, three ſeveral times; yet this was not always, yea but ſeldom put in execution. Some Cohorts that were chaced into their Camp by the <hi>Tuſcans,</hi> and with loſs of their Colours, did not die for it, but were ordered only to lye without the Camp, without ſhelter of either Hut or Tent, till they recovered their reputation. Thoſe that fled from <hi>Cannae</hi> were ordered by the Senate to be carried to <hi>Sicily,</hi> and to remain there till the end of the Punick War, though moſt of them had ſerved out their time. At <hi>Canuſium, Marcellus</hi> ordered thoſe Maniples that had loſt their Enſigns to be fed with Barley inſtead of Wheat, and the Centurions to have their ſwords taken from them, and turned out of the Camp.</p>
                  <p>Sodomy was a capital crime when publickly known. A young Soldier not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Sodomy a capital crime.</note> refuſed to ſuffer one of his Tribunes to abuſe him, but in defending himſelf from force, killed the Tribune, and was acquitted by the Conſul.

Battoning, or the <hi>Fuſtuarium,</hi> is thus deſcribed by <hi>Polybius</hi> in his Sixth Book, The party who was to ſuffer, was brought publickly, (he tells us not to what place of the Camp) and then the Tribune touched him with his Battoon, immediately after (he having liberty to run, as at our <hi>

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Delinquents were puniſht after death, as much as man could puniſh,<note place="margin">Puniſhment after death.</note> for we read of ſome who after they had been cruelly whipped, and their heads cut off, had burial denied them, yea their friends were forbid to mourn for them. But though I confeſs that for giving terrour, horrid crimes deſerve horrid puniſhments, yet I think the conſideration of humane frailty ſhould teach man to be ſhie in inflicting inhumane pains on the living, and be very ſparing to meddle with the dead; for <hi>Savire in manes,</hi> is an aſſured token of a monſtrouſly cruel nature.</p>
                  <p>Several tranſgreſſions were puniſhed by diminiſhing the offenders wages, by<note place="margin">Leſſer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> making them march with the Baggage, winter in the field, both out of Town and Camp, to dig Ditches, more than their Companions did, to ſtand a whole day before the Generals Pavilion, and ſometimes with turfs on their heads; and as I obſerved before, it was no ſmall puniſhment for a Horſeman to have his Horſe taken from him, and be made to ſerve on foot, and this was called <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiae mutatio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Emperours had inveſted themſelves with the Soveraignty of <hi>Rome,</hi> many of them inflicted puniſhments, not <hi>pro ratione delicti,</hi> or according to the quality of the crime, but according to their own boundleſs power, more to ſatisfie their cruel and inhumane natures than to give Juſtice its due courſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong none of the moſt unjuſt you may reckon this, that the Emperour <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> (who did well deſerve the Sirname that was given him of <hi>Severus</hi>) hearing that a young Soldier had injured a poor old woman in ſpoiling her of ſome goods, diſarmed him, declared him a ſlave, and gave him to the woman, that by his work and drudgery he might gain her a livelihood. But theſe I will ſpeak of, had not ſo much of juſtice in them. <hi>Aurelian</hi> put one of his Soldiers to a horrible death for Adultery, by ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Emperour <hi>Macrinus</hi> cauſed a Tribune to be tyed (who had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his Guards to deſert a Poſt) to the wheel of a Cart, and carried him ſo a days march. The ſame Monſter of an Emperour being told that two Soldiers had deflowred their Hoſts ſerving Maid, cauſed immediately the bellies of two
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97406:85"/> Cows to be open'd, out of which the Tripes were taken, and then the Soldiers were ſowed alive in them, but the heads of the Cows were cut off, that ſo the woful couple might ſpeak one to another ſo long as their cruel agony ſuffered them to breath. The Emperour <hi>Avidius Caſſius</hi> cauſed a Pole of the height of one hundred foot to be erected, and cauſed Delinquent Soldiers to be tyed all along to it from the top to the foot of it, and then ſet fire to the loweſt part, in that manner conſuming the miſerable wretches with fire and ſmoke. In our Modern Diſcipline of War, there have been and are yet ſome Nations, who for the ſubtle inventions of atrocious puniſhments, need borrow nothing from the ancient Tyrants, having not only equalized, but far out-reach'd them, as ſhall be told you in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>To return to the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> before the times of the Emperours, when many were found guilty of one Capital crime, all were not put to death, but ſometimes one of five, one of eight, for moſt part one of ten, as <hi>Polybius</hi> tells us in his Sixth Book; and this was called Decimation: he on whom the lot fell, died<note place="margin">Decimation.</note> certainly by Battoning as the ſame Author in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>An Ignominious Diſmiſſion was alſo a <hi>Roman</hi> puniſhment, for with them there were four kinds of Caſhiering or Diſmiſſion: The firſt was when Soldiers had ſerved out their time appointed by Law, and this was called <hi>Juſta miſſio,</hi> a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal diſmiſſion. The ſecond was for juſt and ſufficient reaſons, as when the party<note place="margin">Diſmiſſions.</note> was lame, mutilated, or ſo infirm that he could not ſerve longer, and this they called <hi>Miſſio cauſſaria,</hi> an occaſion'd diſmiſſion. The third was when a General or a Tribune (for ſometimes he had the power to do it) gave a Soldier his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion out of grace and favour, and too often for money, and this was termed <hi>Miſſio gratuita.</hi> The fourth was, when men were put out of the Armies for crimes, and this they called <hi>Miſſio Ignominioſa,</hi> a ſhameful Diſmiſſion, by which <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Ancients propoſed and gave rewards to thoſe who carried themſelves ſignally and valorouſly in any Military occaſion; and to invite them to theſe, the Harangues and publick Orations of their Generals contributed much. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> rewarded thoſe who in their Drillings or Exerciſes carried themſelves better than their Neighbours.

But in the firſt place (as indeed it deſerves the firſt place) he tells us, that after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of any gallant action, the actors were publickly thanked and praiſed<note place="margin">Thanks.</note> by the General in a publick Harangue; and aſſuredly this commendation in ſuch an Audience did not only hugely ſatisfie him or them, in whoſe praiſe it was ſpoke, but ſtirred up in others a vertuous emulation to do, or endeavour to do ſuch things as might deſerve the like honour. After thanks, ſaith our Author, the Conſul gave a Spear, a Lance, or a Javelin to him who had overthrown an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my<note place="margin">Spears.</note> in a private Encounter or Combat, fighting man to man, for ſo he reſtricts the gift. And to him, ſays he, who had overcome and ſpoil'd an enemy, was given (if he were a Horſeman) a Phalera, or ſome Capariſon for a Horſe; and<note place="margin">Capariſons.</note> if a Footman, a Diſh, a Platter, or a Viol, for the Interpreter calls it <hi>Phiala,</hi> which <hi>Lipſius</hi> conjectures very rationally to be a miſtake, and thinks it ſhould be <hi>Armilla,</hi> Bracelets, for we read in ſeverall Authors of theſe gifts, but not of<note place="margin">Bracelets.</note> the other.</p>
                  <p>It is ſtrange that <hi>Polybius</hi> ſpeaks not one word of Triumphs and Ovations, the firſt being the greateſt reward of Valour and Conduct, both for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, magnificence and quality of it, and the laſt next to it. I ſhall
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97406:85"/> ſpeak a little of both. The manner of the Triumph was, that he to whom<note place="margin">Triumph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> it was granted, was carried into the City in a Chariot richly accoutred, drawn ordinarily with white Steeds; and when the <hi>Romans</hi> had over-maſtered <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> with Lions, Tygers, and other wild beaſts that were tamed. He was convoy'd by his Army, who follow'd the Chariot, ſinging Verſes and Rhimes of their own making to the praiſe of the Triumphant. Upon his head he wore a garland of Laurel, the Symbol of Victory; the Soldiers and people cried with loud acclamations, <hi>Io Triumphe.</hi> Before him were carried the rich Spoils, Money and Gold, coined or uncoined, deſtined for the publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury. At firſt the Triumphs were granted by the Senate, thereafter by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">By whom granted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

In that ſame place he tells us of the Conditions on which a Triumph was granted, which were theſe, He muſt have kill'd five thouſand Enemies at leaſt, won much ſpoil, and augmented the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominions and Eſtates.

                  <p>To him, ſaith <hi>Polybius,</hi> who firſt mounted to the Wall of an aſſaulted City, was given a Crown of Gold, as alſo to him who ſaved a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen, or Ally from being kill'd by an enemy, upon whom the party who was ſaved, was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to look as his Saviour, and was compell'd to ſet the Crown on his head if he did not do it willingly.

But on the other part, the Phalangites could not fight in Maniples, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Let us reſume all this, and ſay in one word <hi>Polybius</hi> prefers the Legion to the Phalange, becauſe the eſſential propriety of the Phalange was to fight cloſe together, and ſo long as it was able to keep ſo, it was able to bear down the Legion; but ſure it could but ſeldome keep in one entire body, the Legion, by its order and conſtitution, being apt to fight in ſmall or little Bodies, and to divide according to opportunities and emergencies, could readily enter at the void places of the Phalange, whether theſe were in the Van, Rear or Flanks, and overthrow it, as often it did.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall preſume to add two other advantages that I think the Legion had of<note place="margin">A Legions third advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over the Phalange.</note> the Phalange, which <hi>Polybius</hi> hath not mentioned. The firſt: The Phalange fought all in one Body, the Legion in three Bodies ſucceſſively, one after another; ſo that if the <hi>Haſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ſecond advantage which I conceive the Legion had of the Phalange,<note place="margin">A Legions fourth advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Legion was compoſed of three Bodies, who were marſhall'd one behind another: The <hi>Haſtati</hi> had the firſt Batallion, and were divided into ten Maniples, in every one of which were one hundred and twenty men, theſe were marſhall'd ten deep, and ſo each Maniple was twelve men in Front, for whom allow twelve foot to ſtand on, and, as both <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Vegetius</hi> do, allow three foot between Files, twelve Files have eleven diſtances, and for them you muſt have thirty three foot, add thirty three to twelve, makes forty five; ſo much ground did eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Maniple poſſeſs in Front: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In a Conſular Army there were four Legions, then you are to multiply eight hundred fifty five by four, and the product will prove to be three thouſand four hundred and twenty; and ſo much ground did the <hi>Haſtati</hi> of a Conſular Army take up in Front. Now here the <hi>Haſtati</hi> are reckon'd to be but twelve hundred, the Legion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Polybius</hi> being ſuppos'd to be but four thouſand two hundred. But in <hi>Aemilius</hi> his Army againſt the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Phalanx, the Legions were of ſix thouſand, whereof the <hi>Tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And by this account, <hi>Aemilius</hi> his <hi>Haſtati</hi> would have poſſeſt in Front above five thouſand foot of ground; ſo it is clear, that the <hi>Haſtati</hi> of the weakeſt Conſular Army out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing'd the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Phalange, and thereby was able to fall upon its Flanks; ſuppoſing ſtill, which cannot he deny'd me, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavalry gave the <hi>Grecian</hi> Horſe work enough; and they carrying ſhort managable Arms, might eaſily diſorder the Phalangites, being once enter'd within their great Body, ſo that the <hi>Principes</hi> and <hi>Triarii</hi> coming up freſh to the medley, would not find much difficulty to make that great bulk a prey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Obſerve likewiſe, if you conſider the great Intervals of the <hi>Roman</hi> Maniples, all the Phalangites who in Battel met with theſe Intervals were uſeleſs, for they had no Enemy to fight with. Theſe conjectures of mine I have preſum'd to add to <hi>Polybius</hi> his weightier conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding all that is ſaid for the Legions advantage over the<note place="margin">Reaſons why a Phalanx rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, had the advantage of a Legion.</note> Phalange, I am bold (with ſubmiſſion to <hi>Polybius</hi>) to ſay, If the Phalange be order'd, as I ſpoke of in my Diſcourſes of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Art of War, that is, not ſo deep as ſixteen, and conſequently of a larger Front, and thereby not ſo apt to be ſurrounded or out-wing'd, and with Reſerves, I conceive, not only thoſe conjectures of mine; but all <hi>Polybius</hi> his reaſons will come to nothing, or ſignifie little. Neither indeed can I at all be perſwaded to believe, that ſo ſoon as the Legionaries were enter'd at the void places within the Ranks of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx, that preſently they were Maſters of it; for though the points of thoſe Pikes within which the <hi>Romans</hi> were come, were indeed uſeleſs, yet ſo were not the points of all thoſe Pikes that were at a convenient diſtance from them; beſides, I hope it will be granted, that a Legionaries offenſive weapon, the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:97406:87"/> Sword was no more ſervicable to him at that cloſe fight, than the Sword of a Phalangite was to him that carried it; for it is not imaginable, that he was bound to keep his Pike longer in his hand than it was uſeful for him, nor his Sword in its ſheath, longer than it was time to draw it, in defence of his life. And what I now ſpeak of a Phalange not ſo deep as ſixteen, and conſequently of a greater Front, among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and of Reſerves, which the <hi>Romans</hi> call'd <hi>Subſidia,</hi> is no vain ſpeculation of mine; for I have formerly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the truth of it out of good Authors, though I confeſs, I am convinced ſuch Phalanges were not at <hi>Cinecephala,</hi> where <hi>Q. Flaminius</hi> beat <hi>Philip</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor at <hi>Pidna,</hi> where <hi>L. Aemilius</hi> beat <hi>Perſeus</hi> the Son, both Kings of <hi>Macedon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To confirm my opinion that the Legion by its conſtitution, had no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Roman</hi> Army beat by <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tippus</hi> a <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi>
                     </note> over a Phalange rightly order'd, I ſhall uſe the authority of <hi>Polybius</hi> againſt <hi>Polybius;</hi> for he in his firſt Book relates to us, how the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in the firſt Punick War were brought ſo low, that they were ready to accept any reaſonable conditions of Peace, till they gave the command of their forces to <hi>Zantippus,</hi> a <hi>Lacedaemonian,</hi> that had come out of <hi>Greece</hi> with ſome mercenary <hi>Laconians,</hi> and was one of thoſe, who in this age are called Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Fortune, who making uſe of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Rules, which he had learn'd in his own Countrey, marſhall'd the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army in ſeveral Bodies of Horſe and Foot, each to ſecond another; adding the help of his Elephants, and chuſing the moſt Champaign grounds he could, extended his Front to ſo great a length, that the <hi>Romans</hi> uſing their accuſtom'd order, were out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing'd, ſurrounded, and totally routed by him; and the Conſul, <hi>Attilius Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus,</hi> with five hundred more <hi>Romans,</hi> were led Captive into <hi>Carthage.</hi> Here <hi>Xantippus</hi> meerly by the <hi>Grecian</hi> Art of War, worſted the <hi>Romans,</hi> who made uſe of their own Art.</p>
                  <p>But I will go a greater length, may not we imagine, that <hi>Amilcar</hi> in the <note place="margin">And by <hi>Amil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> and <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tippus</hi> his Art,</note> purſuance of that firſt Punick War, and his Son <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the beginning of the ſecond, imitated <hi>Xantippus,</hi> and manag'd the War according to that pattern he had left behind him? I ſuppoſe we may believe it. If this do not prove that the difference between the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Art of War did not always make the one Nation victorious over the other, then take more Inſtances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epirus,</hi> at his firſt coming into <hi>Italy</hi> with a <hi>Grecian</hi> Army,<note place="margin">And by <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Grecian</hi> Arms, and Art of War, did beat the <hi>Romans</hi> in Battel, ſo did he the ſecond time. A fancy took him to arm his Souldiers after the <hi>Roman</hi> faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then he was beaten by the <hi>Romans. Hannibal,</hi> when he came firſt to <hi>Italy,</hi> beat the <hi>Romans</hi> in ſet Battel, and I believe with theſe kind of Arms, and that order of War which <hi>Xantippus</hi> uſed in <hi>Africk,</hi> and conſequently <hi>Grecian.</hi> But <hi>Polybius</hi> tells us in his ſeventeenth Book, that the ſame <hi>Hannibal</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To what <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes Victory.</note> armed all his <hi>Carthaginians</hi> after the <hi>Roman</hi> manner, no doubt, with those Arms that he had taken from them; now as he had beaten them formerly with <hi>Carthaginian</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> Arms, ſo he beat them frequently afterward with <hi>Roman</hi> Arms. Therefore this noble Hiſtorian in that place doth not attribute <hi>Hannibals</hi> Victories to any advantage his Souldiers had, either in Arms or Art over the <hi>Romans,</hi> but to his own ſingular Prudence, his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Conduct, and extraordinary Qualifications, and to uſe <hi>Polybius</hi> his own expreſſion, <hi>His Capital Engine.</hi> But when, ſaith he, a <hi>Roman</hi> General, equal in abilities to him, came to command the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies, then Victory flew from <hi>Hannibal</hi> over to <hi>Scipio.</hi> But let us ask the queſtion, Why ſo? Since both Captains were equal in Valour and Conduct, and if there was any odds, the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> no queſtion, had it, becauſe of his long experience, and almoſt matchleſs policy in feats of Arms, and that there was but little difference in their Arms, or manner of Militia. Here <hi>Polybius</hi> is at a ſtand, and gives no reaſon for it, but that Fortune would have it ſo. What Fortune was to him, that is Providence to us. He was ignorant of what the wiſeſt<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> Ch. 3. and Ch. 9.</note> of men ſaid long before the foundation of <hi>Rome</hi> was laid, <hi>That there is a time for every purpoſe under Heaven, a time to kill, and a time to heal, a time to gain, and a time to loſe.</hi> And in another place, <hi>That the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong, nor favour to the men of skill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but time and chance happeneth to

Nor did <hi>Polybius</hi> know what was reveal'd to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> in that dream which <hi>Daniel</hi> interpreted to him; that the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>

                  <p>If <hi>Polybius</hi> had liv'd in our days, he might have ſeen the hand of Heaven diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting Victory (to ſpeak with reverence and ſubmiſſion to the Almighties plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) more partially, than he either heard it was awarded in the <hi>Hannibalian,</hi> or ſaw it given in the third Punick War: of the firſt whereof he writes, when he falls upon this diſcourſe with us, He might have ſeen men of one Nation, arm'd alike, following one and the ſame method of War, and for any thing I know, of equal Courage, both parties inflam'd, the one with Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al zeal, the other with rebellious rage, acting their parts very highly on the bloody ſtage of War: he might have ſeen, I ſay, the beſt of Soveraign Kings<note place="margin">King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt.</note> loſe his Crown and Life, and have his head chopp'd off with an Ax, when the worſt of Subjects and greateſt of Rebels had his deck'd with Bays.</p>
                  <p>Or if <hi>Polybius</hi> had liv'd but one age longer than he did, he might have ſeen the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, (which he ſo much commends) cutting one anothers Throats, all Countrey-men, all men of equal Courage and Conduct, arm'd alike, uſing one and the ſame Art and Diſcipline of War, embruing their hands in one anothers blood; and thoſe who fought for the State and Liberty of their Countrey, overthrown, kill'd, murther'd, and maſſacred, and their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies almoſt ador'd for their ſucceſs in a bad cauſe: and he might have either ſeen or heard of <hi>Pompeys</hi> Head ignominiouſly ſtruck off, and <hi>Caeſars</hi> crown'd<note place="margin">

                  <p>And if <hi>Polybius</hi> had been an eye-witneſs of the prodigious ſucceſs <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> the Great King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had in <hi>Germany</hi> in the year 1630. when he invaded the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and how he took Cities, Forts and Caſtles, more<note place="margin">Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second,</note> for their number, and more conſiderable for their Strength, Beauty, and Riches, in the ſpace of ſix months; and made a greater progreſs in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in leſs than two years time, than <hi>Hannibal</hi> did in <hi>Italy</hi> the whole eighteen years he ſtay'd in it: If, I ſay, he had ſeen this, he had never attributed Victory to the goodneſs of Arms, the cunning of the Art or exactneſs of the Diſcipline of War, for he would have ſeen the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Seconds Generals, wiſe,<note place="margin">And his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals.</note> couragious, experienced, vigilant as well, and as much as either the King himſelf, or any of his great Captains.

But <hi>Paruta</hi> refutes <hi>Livius,</hi> yet I have ſeen none that oppoſeth Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> and I am ſure I ſhall not, becauſe I am not ſo much beholding to the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> as to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But thoſe who are curious to read the reaſons of all the three, may find thoſe of <hi>Livy</hi> in his ninth Book of his firſt Decad; thoſe of <hi>Paruta</hi> in the ſecond Chapter of his Political Diſcourſes; and thoſe of <hi>Raleigh</hi> in the firſt Chapter of the fifth Book of the firſt part of his Hiſtory of the World.</p>
                  <p>But to return to <hi>Livy</hi>'s queſtion, I ſhall tell my opinion, and that is lawful<note place="margin">Strong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Livius</hi> his opinion.</note> enough for me to do, and it is this: Since <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as <hi>Polybius</hi> confeſſeth, carried not much above twenty thouſand men over the <hi>Alps,</hi> of all that great Army that he brought out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and with them durſt invade the <hi>Roman</hi> Seignories in <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf, when <hi>Rome</hi> was Miſtreſs of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and of the Sea too; when <hi>Hannibal,</hi> I ſay, notwithſtanding the <hi>Roman</hi> power, and all the obſtructions that <hi>Hanno</hi> and his party made againſt him within <hi>Carthage,</hi> durſt fight, and did beat the <hi>Romans</hi> ſo often, that if he had purſued one of his Victories, he had gone fair to have ſet up his Trophies in the Capitol. When with ſuch a ſtock <hi>Hannibal</hi> could do ſo great things, I think, in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane probability, <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was maſter of the beſt and richeſt places of the World, who was an abſolute Soveraign Monarch (and ſo not liable or accountable to a Senate) not in fear or jealouſie of any Competitor, a great and an experienced Warriour, of an Invincible Courage, Maſter of prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Forces both at Sea and Land, his power almoſt boundleſs, and yet his Ambition more unlimited than his Power; If he, I ſay, had enter'd <hi>Italy,</hi> and invaded the <hi>Roman</hi> State (then but in its Infancy, and ſhouldering for more room with its neighbour Cities) he had made it ſubmit to his uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable pleaſure, or drown'd the very <hi>Roman</hi> name in the pit of eternal Oblivion.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E who will rightly ſhape or form that monſtrous Beaſt that<note place="margin">War the wild Boar of the Forreſt.</note> 
                     <hi>Bellua,</hi> that wild Boar of the Foreſt, that plucketh up all Vineyards by the roots, War; muſt begin, ſaith <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> with the Belly: meaning, Proviſions and Victuals muſt be prepared to maintain the Armies of thoſe Princes and States, who wage War. And becauſe meat in an orderly way coſts money, they ſay money is the ſinews of War; yet we have ſeen and known Armies rais'd and maintain'd with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no money, prepared by thoſe who levied them, but ſome exceptions take not away an univerſal rule.</p>
                  <p>How the ancient Nations, as well <hi>Grecians, Romans,</hi> as others ſhap'd this Beaſt of War, how they compoſed his members, and how they entertain'd and fed him, both for their own defence, and to offend others, I have ſhew'd to my Reader in my former Diſcourſes, as far at leaſt as by conjectures rationally grounded on the authority of approved Authors, (beſides <hi>Aelian, Aeneas, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybius,</hi>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:97406:90"/> and <hi>Vegetius</hi>) it was poſſible for me to reach. But coming now to ſpeak of the <hi>Modern Art of War,</hi> I find my ſelf more embarraſſed than in the deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the reſt; for beſides the differences of the manner of War uſed by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nations (which perhaps might all be digeſted in one form with ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions not very eſſential) I know not of what date, age, years, or Centuries of<note place="margin">Modern Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain date.</note> years, I ſhall make the Modern Militia. If I ſhall date its Birth from the time the <hi>Roman</hi> Art of War began to be corrupted, I ſhould perhaps make it too old; for <hi>Vegetius</hi> complains that the ſubſtance of that was well near ſpent, and no more but a ſhadow of it left long before his time; which mov'd the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Valentinian</hi> to command him to compoſe a Syſteme of the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Conſtitutions of War, which had been needleſs if they had been then in vigor: and how <hi>Vegetius</hi> hath acquitted himſelf of that undertaking, I have already told you. But if I ſhould date the age of the Modern Art of War from the time that Gunpowder was invented, I might perhaps hit right enough at its age, becauſe no doubt Gunpowder made a great alteration on the whole face and body of War. But I am ſure I have but few, or rather no helps to write the Series of its Hiſtory, either from the decay of the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia, or from the time that Gunpowder was heard to make ſo loud and ſo fearful a noiſe in the World.</p>
                  <p>Though we are told that the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> cuſtoms of War were worn out<note place="margin">The Militia of ſeveral ages forgot;</note> of uſe, yet none tell us when either they were reſtor'd, or yet what others were brought in their room. Neither do we find that thoſe who wrote Hiſtories after the decadency of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire give us light in it; or yet what kind of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia was uſed by thoſe Nations who had the confidence with their ſharp ſwords to cut out to themſelves very large portions of the great bulk of that almoſt Univerſal Monarchy. From Hiſtory we know that the <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Vandals,</hi> the<note place="margin">As that of the <hi>Goths, Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi> and <hi>Huns.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Huns,</hi> and the <hi>Longobards,</hi> invaded the Empire, and fought many ſucceſsful Battels with ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, and their Lieutenants, and that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd Kingdoms by feats of War, and got them confirm'd to them by articles of peace. But what order theſe Nations kept in Modelling their Armies, what Diſcipline to preſerve them, how they arm'd them, what art they us'd in Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batelling, fighting, or taking Towns, none of the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers that I know of, hath either told us, or given us ground to conjecture, except a few things of one of the <hi>Theodoricks</hi> King of the <hi>Goths.</hi> And from thoſe Nations who were Barbarians, who it may be knew not what it was to read or write, we are not in reaſon to expect any ſignificant account.</p>
                  <p>As little do we know what manner of Militia was uſed in <hi>France, Germany, Batavia,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> when they firſt emancipated themſelves from the ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction<note place="margin">That of the ancient <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavians.</hi>
                     </note> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. The Victories the <hi>Saracens</hi> had in all the three known parts of the World, the whole power of the Emperours of <hi>Greece</hi> in the Eaſt, with almoſt innumerable Armies from the Weſt to recover the Holy Land from thoſe <hi>Saracens</hi> (long before the name of a <hi>Turk</hi> was heard of) not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">That of the <hi>Saracens.</hi>
                     </note> able to keep <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> long from them, demonſtrate that they were well arm'd, well train'd, and had a Diſcipline of War, and that a very exquiſite one; but what it was, we are yet to ſeek, for any thing we find in Hiſtory, and yet thoſe Expeditions are very famous, and ſtand authentically recorded. We read that <hi>Charles Martel</hi> Major of the Palace in <hi>France,</hi> made War with the<note place="margin">That of <hi>Charles Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. Pepin</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Great.</note> 
                     <hi>Saracens,</hi> and in one Battel which he fought in <hi>Provence,</hi> laid one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of them in the duſt. His Son <hi>Pepin</hi> made a ſucceſsful War againſt the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> at the inſtance of Pope <hi>Zachary;</hi> ſo did his Son <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, againſt both them, the Pagan <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Moors in <hi>Spain;</hi> but how the Armies of either the one party or the other were arm'd, model'd, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall'd, or Embattel'd, is wrapt up in the abyſs of dark oblivion.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall we ſay ſince Fire-guns alter'd many of the ancient cuſtoms of War, and by piecemeal hath obtained the pre-eminence over almoſt all offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive weapons, and challenges the Prerogative even before and over the Sword, the Lance, and the Pike, much more over the Bow, the Arrow, Dart, Jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin and Sling: and yet from Hiſtory we are no more acquainted with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of War ſince they came in uſe, than we were before their invention; of the truth whereof take a ſhort view.</p>
                  <p>What vaſt Provinces and goodly Countries the <hi>Turk</hi> ſince the birth of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, hath acquired in <hi>Aſia, Africk,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> is obvious to our ſight, though
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:97406:90"/> the Hiſtories of all Nations were ſilent. And though in the general we are told<note place="margin">We have but confuſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</note> that his order is good, the Government and Diſcipline obſerv'd in his nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Armies is ſtrict and excellent, yet the particulars have been hitherto rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us but very confuſedly: neither doth Mr. <hi>Rycaut</hi> in his Book of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, Printed a few years ago, help us much, but rather gives us occaſion to think that the <hi>Turks</hi> have loſt their ancient Art of War; or if they ſtill retain it, we muſt wonder how theſe Unbelievers have triumph'd over ſo many both Chriſtian and <hi>Mahometan</hi> people, with ſo undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin'd and diſorderly multitudes, as his relation makes them to be; for he ſaith, their principal Foot which are the <hi>Janizaries</hi> (reputed to have been the ſtrength and ſupport of that great Monarchy) fight confuſedly; and the <hi>Spahies</hi> (who are the beſt of their Cavalry) fight likewiſe in little good order; he ſays, that ſometimes they charge thrice, and if they then break not the enemy, they fly; and withal he makes their Artillery very inſignificant, in regard that as he writes, they have no Gunners but ſuch as either they take Priſoners, or are ſold to them for Slaves, who ſtay no longer with them than any fair opportunity is offer'd them to run away.</p>
                  <p>Though perhaps the Victories which the great <hi>Tamberlan</hi> obtain'd, and the<note place="margin">And of <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlans</hi> order of War;</note> celerity he uſed in making theſe Conqueſts, which have render'd him ſo famous, be not ſo vaſt as Stories make them; yet we may believe his Atchievements to have been extraordinary, in regard the Great <hi>Mogul</hi> of <hi>India</hi> derives his Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in a lineal deſcent from him, and at this day poſſeſſeth a vaſt and a Great Empire, which is but a remnant of a far greater acquir'd by <hi>Tamberlan,</hi> whoſe Diſcipline is cry'd up to have been exceeding ſtrict, his Art of War ſo exact and orderly, that he never went out of the Field without Victory, or from a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged Town without either its ſubmiſſion or deſtruction. It is written of him that the day he fought with <hi>Bajazet</hi> at Mount <hi>Stella,</hi> his Army conſiſted of a Million of men, and yet he made uſe of them all in the time of the Battel. If this be all true, is it not pity that the manner of his Encamping, Beſieging, Embattelling, and fighting is not left on record to poſterity?</p>
                  <p>And to come home, the <hi>Scottiſh,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Hiſtories tell us, what bloody Engagements have been among them, and what Battels have been fought with various ſucceſs: but except that we are told that the <hi>French</hi>
                     <note place="margin">As alſo of the <hi>Scötiſh, French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Gens de Armes</hi> were numerous, beſides their other Cavalry; that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> uſed the Bow and the Bill, and had men of Arms likewiſe; and that the <hi>Scots</hi> fought on Horſeback with Lances and Jacks of Mail, and on foot with long Pikes, Battel-axes, Bows, and two-handed Swords; what know we more of the Art of War that any of all the three practis'd, of the order they kept, how ſtrong their ſeveral Bodies and Batallions were, or what names they gave them, how deep they Marſhal'd either their Horſe or Foot, how they Embattell'd, how they Encamped, and how they form'd their Sieges? for all theſe we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ill grounded conjectures, and very confuſed notions.</p>
                  <p>I know not whom we ſhall juſtly blame for this great defect, but the ſeveral Generals of ſeveral Armies, belonging to ſeveral Nations, and in ſeveral ages, who if either they could not, or would not write the Hiſtory of their own or others actions, (as <hi>Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Thucydides</hi> among the <hi>Grecians, Julius Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Many Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.</note> among the <hi>Romans, Monluc,</hi> and a few others in our Modern times), yet I think they were obliged to cauſe their Secretaries to keep exact accounts of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of theſe Sieges, and thoſe Battels which under their Command were either form'd or fought, that ſo they might have been tranſmitted to poſterity. Some have done ſo, but moſt have neglected it, thinking it enough if their actions were generally remember'd, recommending the particulars to the information of Hiſtorians, which many times is ſuch that it looks rather like a Romance than a true ſtory. But I had rather you ſhould hear <hi>Monluc</hi> that famous Marſhal of <hi>France</hi> upon this Subject, who in the Third Book of his firſt Tome, ſays, That Hiſtorians who write the feats of War, deſcribe ſeldom or never the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Monluc</hi> his Complaint of them.</note> of the action, as how ſuch a Caſtle was ſurprized, in what order ſuch a Town was aſſaulted, or in what manner defended, how ſuch two Armies were Marſhal'd before they join'd in Battel, how the Horſemen were arm'd, and how the Foot, with many more circumſtances neceſſary to be known by thoſe who in time coming deſire to be inſtructed, and eſpecially ſuch as intend
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:97406:91"/> to ſerve their Prince and Country in Military Employments, that from thence they may learn how to demean themſelves in the like occaſions. But, ſays he, the whole multitude of Hiſtoriographers conceive they do enough if they tell us ſuch a Battel was fought, ſuch a Prince or General gain'd the Victory, ſuch a City was beſieged and yielded, and ſuch a one was taken by aſſault. For himſelf, he profeſſeth he wrote his Commentaries to be regiſters of the actions of his time, the particulars whereof might ſerve to inform thoſe who were to come after him, how to carry themſelves either in Sieges, Aſſaults, Skirmiſhes, Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, or Batte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; for thoſe, ſaith he, who think they know not ſo much as I, will be glad to learn of me, but thoſe who fancy they know enough already, need no Maſter. In another place he ſays, Hiſtorians are to be blam'd for not writing particular things, and of particular men: they think, ſays he, they do enough if they name Princes, or Captain-Generals, and paſs over with ſilence all other perſons that are not of ſo large a Stature. Thus far <hi>Monluc</hi> Marſhal of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this ſame purpoſe you may ſee <hi>Polybius</hi> his complaint in his Twelfth Book,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Polybius</hi> his complaint of them.</note> where he ſays, Hiſtorians firſt err, in not writing things truly, and as they were done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and next that they give no particular account of the manner of Battels, Skirmiſhes, Surpriſals, and Sieges: and this he attributeth to their want of skill, and therefore wiſheth that all great Captains would write the Hiſtories of their own actions themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Complaints of <hi>Polybius</hi> and <hi>Monluc</hi> are juſt: but I complain of another kind of Hiſtorians, who take upon them to give us deſcriptions of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In his fourth Book, he makes it one of his Maxims, that all good Captains ſhould rather receive than give the charge; of this I ſpoke in the Nineteenth<note place="margin">Firſt obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</note> Chapter of my Eſſays of the <hi>Roman</hi> Art of War, here I ſhall tell you the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he gives for his opinion.

                     </hi> Charge at <hi>Pharſalia:</hi> but of this I ſpoke enough in another place.</p>
                  <p>In that ſame Fourth Book this Author ſhews us how an enemy may be ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in time of Battel, and I pray you obſerve the Leſſon he gives how to do it: Firſt, ſaith he, let the front of your Army be Marſhal'd equal with that of your<note place="margin">Second.</note> enemy; then, ſays he, let your front retire by little and little, and your flanks ſtanding ſtill ſhall environ your enemy. I doubt not but <hi>Machiavel</hi> thought this a ſquint device, but it is a fancy only beſeeming a Gentleman of the long robe. If he had ſaid, let your Battel ſtand, and your wings extend themſelves, he had ſpoke ſome ſenſe; but a front to retire is an improper ſpeech, and unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the Art of War: for in ſtrict and proper language a Front and a Reer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts but each of them of one rank, whether that be of ten, a hundred, a thouſand, ten thouſand, or twenry thouſand Men, or Horſe; ſo the firſt rank which is the Front cannot retire further than ſix or three foot allowed to be between it and the ſecond rank, unleſs all the ranks, and conſequently the whole Batallion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97406:92"/> I grant there be ſome who will have the half of the ranks to be the Front, and the other half the Reer, as in our Foot Batallions, which are ſix deep, the three firſt ranks make the Front, the other three the Reer; but this, as I think, is not proper language, neither will it help <hi>Machiavel;</hi> for his Front of the three firſt ranks cannot retire till the three laſt ranks (that are behind them) retire firſt. Beſides all this, I doubt if in <hi>Machiavels</hi> time, Captains might well hazard more<note place="margin">Third.</note> than now, to command a Batallion of men to retire, for fear they could not get them to advance again, at leaſt not ſo readily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Juſtus Lipſius</hi> had reaſon to accuſe <hi>Machiavel</hi> of groſs ignorance for denying the right ordering of a Militia to be an Art, and certainly his conceit to do ſo<note place="margin">Fourth.</note> was very extravagant; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſides he contradicts himſelf, for he calls his Treatiſe of War, <hi>I ſette libri del'arte della guerra di Nicolo Machiavelli,</hi> Seven Books of the Art of War of <hi>Nicol Machiavell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed Soldiers are very little bound to him; for he ſays, neither Prince nor State ſhould ſuffer any of thoſe who profeſs to live by the Art of War, to dwell under them; nor doth, ſaith he, any vertuous or good man uſe it as an art; and adds, that thoſe who do ſo, muſt of neceſſity be falſe, fraudulent, treacherous, and violent, for they muſt (ſaith this Doctor) either obſtruct all peace, that the War continuing, they may thereby be maintained, or they muſt pill, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and make ſpoil of other mens goods in the time of War, that thereby they may maintain themſelves in the time of peace. This is bad enough if it be all true.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are his goodly arguments which are but his own idle dreams, for it is<note place="margin">Fifth Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> no difficil matter to keep men who make profeſſion of Arms within the bounds of their duty, even when they but ſeldom receive their wages; and this in this age is viſible to the whole world. Nor can many Inſtances be given where men of War obſtructed that peace which their Maſters deſir'd, or which both parties were contented to make. And if after the concluſion of a peace, and disbanding of Armies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any exorbitancies chance to be committed by the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (as ſeldom any ſuch thing falls out) they have been occaſion'd by too great a defalcation of their pay, with the half or moity whereof all Modern Soldiers will be heartily well contented, ſo perfectly have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they learn'd the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> Leſſon in the Goſpel, to be content with their wages.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude, I know not whether I ſhall more cry up the lowlineſs of ſpirit of thoſe great Stateſmen who are pleaſed to deſcend from their high<note place="margin">Corollary.</note> Spheres to learn their Politicks from <hi>Machiavell,</hi> or commend the generoſity of thoſe Captains who diſdain to ſtoop ſo low as to receive their Leſſons of the Military Art from the Town Clerk of <hi>Florence.</hi>

                  <p>ARmies are properly the members of the great Body of War, and men are the ſinews of Armies. The beſt choice, election, or levy of men is of<note place="margin">Voluntary Levy.</note> the ſubjects of that Prince or State who maketh the War, where the Law of the Land impoſeth a neceſſity on men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>it for ſervice, to enroll themſelves according to their ſeveral ranks and qualities. And this Levy alters its nature according to the nature of the War, for if that be a Defenſive one, the Levy is Voluntary, for ordinarily men riſe willingly in arms for the defence of their Country, Lives, Wives and Children. But if the War be an Offenſive one, intended to invade a ſtranger, and ſuch as leads Natives from their Countries and Homes, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them to foreign lands; it is not univerſally voluntary, and very oft gets the name of a Preſs. In this kind of Levy moſt Nations followed the cuſtom of<note place="margin">Preſs.</note> the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and choſe moſt of their Cavalry out of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or the better ſort, and the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Infantry out of the Commons; but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that cuſtom is now vaniſhed, and we have ſcarce the ſhadow of it left with us.</p>
                  <p>The Emperours of the High <hi>Dutch</hi> Nation, the <hi>German</hi> Princes, and Imperial Towns, by the old Conſtitutions of the Empire, made an Election or Levy of their Subjects according to their Laws, ſometimes the tenth, ſometimes the ſixth, or fifth man, or according to their Eſtates, in all their Wars, both ſince<note place="margin">Manner of the ancient Levy in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
                     </note> the <hi>Turk</hi> became their unwelcome neighbour, and before he had footing in <hi>Europe.</hi> It is not above fourſcore and ten years ſince in the raign of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Second, all that were Enrolled in the <hi>German</hi> Cavalry were by birth Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; it is true they brought ſome of them one, ſome two, and ſome three with them, who waited on them, well horſed and armed, for whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd wages, and were ſubject to articles of War; but theſe were called in their language <hi>Einſpanneers,</hi> to diſtinguiſh them from the Maſters, who were of neceſſity to be all Gentlemen, a cuſtom worn clear out, moſt of <hi>German</hi> Troops being now compoſed of <hi>Einſpanneers,</hi> without Gentlemen, unleſs it be the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and not all of them neither.</p>
                  <p>The Commiſſion of array in <hi>England</hi> is an excellent order, by which an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my<note place="margin">In <hi>England.</hi>
                     </note> Royal may be brought together either for defence, or invaſion in a very ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>The ancient cuſtom of Levy in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as we are told, was to command all between ſixteen and ſixty years of age to appear in every Shire, and you need<note place="margin">In <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </note> not doubt but out of theſe an Election was made of ſuch a number as the Kings Lieutenants thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it. But in latter times a far better and more expedient way was found out, and that was to impoſe the raiſing ſuch a number of Horſe and Foot on every Shire proportionably according to the true valuation of the Eſtates of the Heritors and Proprietaries. Aſſuredly a way very orderly, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical, and juſt, provided it never be made uſe of in an unjuſt cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The Kings of <hi>Sweden</hi> have conſtantly ſtanding forces within the Kingdom to<note place="margin">In <hi>Sweden.</hi>
                     </note> prevent both Invaſions and Inſurrections; they conſiſt of Regiments and Troops, which have their denominations from the Provinces where they are raiſed, and where they reſide, they have their Officers and Colours, and are appointed at ſeveral times to meet, muſter and exerciſe, but are not in pay, only ſome ſmall thing is given to the Captain and the Enſign, who ordinarily are their Drill-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and upon that account get wages. But theſe Troops and Regiments are ſometimes carried out of <hi>Sweden</hi> to foreign Wars, and that in great numbers,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97406:93"/> and others appointed to be raiſed in their rooms. As in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth they were carried to <hi>Liefland,</hi> againſt both <hi>Pole</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> in the time of <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> and his Daughter Queen <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> to <hi>Livonia, Pruſſia,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and more lately by <hi>Charles Guſtavus</hi> to <hi>Pruſſia, Livonia, Pole, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Denmark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> have their Countrey Militia for defence of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">In <hi>Denmark.</hi>
                     </note> but are neither ſo orderly nor ſo numerous as thoſe of <hi>Sweden,</hi> neither do they take them ſo frequently to foreign expeditions as of old they did, when by their mighty Armies they invaded many places of <hi>Germany, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and made an entire conqueſt of <hi>Normandy.</hi> But theſe were like the inundations of the <hi>Huns, Lombards, Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> (which two laſt, both the <hi>Sweedes</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> pretend to be their Anceſtors) on the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
                  <p>The like of ſuch an Election or Levy hath been in former times uſed in<note place="margin">In <hi>Spain.</hi>

                     <hi>Spain,</hi> and may be yet.

                  <p>The ſecond kind of Levy is when Princes and States impoſe no neceſſity on<note place="margin">Second kind of Levy.</note> their Subjects to riſe, but for making up their Armies, invite by Trumpet and Drum all to take imployment, whom either the deſire of honour, riches, booty, pay or wages may encourage to undergo their ſervice. And this is that kind of Election which now is univerſally and properly enough called a Levy. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the only Voluntary Election, becauſe the parties elect themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<note place="margin">A Voluntary Levy deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> the conſtraint of any Law, none being preſt to the ſervice but ſuch who of their own inclinations engage themſelves, and give their names to be Enrolled. By this kind of Levy have moſt foreign Princes and States in our days raiſed their Armies, the manner of it is ſhortly this: The Prince or State makes choice of Colonels both for Horſe and Foot, to whom they give Commiſſions or Patents to raiſe Regiments of ſuch a number of Companies, and ſuch a number of men in each Company or Troop as the Prince or State thinks fit; to this purpoſe they give every Colonel a ſum of money, ſo much for every Horſeman, every Dragoon, and every Footman, as they and that Colonel can agree. And theſe ſums vary oft according to the fewneſs of Soldiers, the numbers of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Leviers, and the danger of the War, or good or bad pay of him who wageth it; ſo that I have known ten Crowns not ſufficient for a Foot ſoldier, where four would have ſerv'd the turn three or four years before. The Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels are limited ordinarily to ſuch a time to have their Regiments ready, and for that purpoſe have a place of Rendezvouz appointed to them. The Colonels themſelves give Patents to their Lieutenant-Colonels, Majors, Ritmaſters, and Captains, and they to their Lieutenants, Enſigns, Cornets, Quarter maſters, Serjeants, and Corporals, immediately after Trumpets are ſounded, and Drums beaten, and thoſe who preſent themſelves, receive levy-moneys, and thereafter are entertain'd, and their names being Enrolled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are no more free, but bound to ſerve. Obſerve here that the Prince or State make choice of ſuch Colonels as they think moſt proper to raiſe men for their ſervice, either in their own Countries, or foreign ones, where Levies are permitted to be made for them, by their friends, Confederates and Allies.</p>
                  <p>The Emperors <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second and the Third, and this Emperour <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Made uſe of by moſt of Princes in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times.</note> levied all their great Armies in the time of their long and bloody Wars by ſound of Trumpet, and beat of Drum. So have all the <hi>German</hi> Princes, and moſtly the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> The great King of <hi>Sweden, Guſtavus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus,</hi> his Daughter <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> and the late <hi>Swediſh</hi> King <hi>Charles Guſtavus</hi> made up moſt of their Armies, and ſo did <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the fourth King of <hi>Denmark</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:97406:94"/> ſome Regiments of their native <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi>) of <hi>Dutch, Scots,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> raiſed all by this manner of Levy. But hereby you may eaſily fancy that the ancient diſtinction and difference between the Cavalry and Infantry, as to their birth and breeding, is wholly taken away, mens qualities and extractions, being little or rather juſt nothing either regarded or inquired after; the moſt of the Horſemen, as well as of the Foot, being compoſed of the very ſcum of the Commons.</p>
                  <p>But there is worſe than that, for where a War is of any long continuance,<note place="margin">Abuſes and Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Levy.</note> that Armies mouldring away, either new Regiments muſt be levied, or the old recruited; this kind of Levy is groſly abuſed, and many there are who make a trade of it, taking money from one, and preſently running over to another. As I ſaid before, ſcarceneſs of Soldiers is the cauſe why Princes are the more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral of their Levy-moneys, he who carries the heavieſt purſe ordinarily being maſter of moſt men; and this procures another great inconvenience and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; the deſire to be fingering a beneficial new Levy-money, inticeth many to run from their Colours, and deſert their Maſters ſervice. In the long <hi>German</hi> War I have known in one Imperial Town ſix or ſeven Captains (whereof my ſelf was one) all levying for ſeveral Maſters, and ſome Rogues receive money from moſt of us, and yet go out of Town with none of us.</p>
                  <p>If theſe and many other inconveniences be conſider'd, we may conclude the<note place="margin">Safeſt way of Levy.</note> ſureſt and the ſafeſt way of Levy, is that a Prince or State makes of their own Subjects, or of thoſe whom they receive as Auxiliaries from their Allies, as the great ſtock of the forces of the Eſtates of the United Provinces of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi>

                  <p>In all kinds of Levies ſuch Officers ſhould be choſen as are men of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,<note place="margin">What Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould be elected.</note> and of ſome experience in Military matters. As to the Soldiers, whether ther they be to ſerve on Horſe or Foot, the ſtature is not to be look'd to ſo much (whether it be tall, mean, or indifferent) as the proportionable and cleanly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of all the members of the body, which muſt be compact and ſtrong, a manly face, with lively, vigorous eyes, which denote the quickneſs and vivacity of the mind, apt to learn what belongs to his Art. If the Souldier be to ſerve on Foot, he ought to be ſuch as hath been inur'd to toil and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; for which purpoſe, as the <hi>Roman</hi> cuſtome was, choice ſhould be made of ſuch young fellows who have had their breeding rather in the Countrey, than in Towns, unleſs they be Mechanicks, that are not of a Sedentary Trade. If he be to ſerve on Horſe, and that the Levy be not made by the Trumpet, but where a right Election may be got, only ſuch ſhould be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, as are of an honeſt birth, for their reputation will make them undergo any fatigue, and a little time will inure them to toil, though they have been bred with eaſe and plenty.</p>
                  <p>I have formerly ſhown you what years made a man capable to be enroll'd a Souldier, among the Ancients. I ſhall tell you now, that though it be not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally<note place="margin">Souldiers age.</note> look'd to by many, yet I find, that in our Modern Wars, moſt Captains conceive ſixteen years to be too young, and if ſo, I ſwear ſixty is too old; they need not be twenty, for if they be of ſuch Bodies as I have deſcrib'd, they may paſs muſter of eighteen; and if they be not infirm, wounded or mutilated, they may well enough continue Souldiers till they be fifty and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; though, ſome think, they ſhould not ſerve after the forty ſixth year of their age. So upon this account of mine, thoſe who levy, may enrol ſuch as are not under eighteen, nor above fifty: And this may be eaſily obſerved in Countrey Elections, where there is choice, yet very often it is not done, for which the Officers are to be blam'd. But in that other Voluntary Levy made by the Drum, where Souldiers are hired for Moneys, the age is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome look'd to, old and young, being promiſcuouſly enroll'd, which is an intrinſecal defect of that kind of Levy. If men may not be enroll'd after the forty ſixth or fiftieth year of their age, it follows, they ſhould then have their diſmiſſion, yet that is but ſeldome practis'd, Neceſſity (which is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97406:94"/> limited by no Law) detaining them very often many years beyond that time, which is no new thing, having been often practis'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and<note place="margin">How long they ſhould ſerve.</note> other Ancients, as I have ſhown before. Some limit the time of a Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſervice from his Enrolling, which is juſt. The <hi>Sweedes</hi> order their Foot Souldiers of their own Countrey to ſerve twenty five years, ſtrangers fifteen; but if they followed the <hi>Roman</hi> way, the Horſe-men ſhould ſerve but half that time. The <hi>French</hi> King is more gracious to Souldiers, eſpecially to ſtrangers, whom he orders to get their Diſmiſſions (if they require them) after they have ſerved four or five years.</p>
                  <p>But for all I have ſaid, I know not why all Kings, Princes, and Free States, in their Election and Levy of Souldiers, ſhould not follow the example of the Great King of kings, and Lord of lords, who (as you may read in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Numbers</hi>) order'd his Servant <hi>Moſes</hi> to muſter all Males fit for the War, of twenty years old and upwards, and therefore we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, he thought all under that age unfit to go to the Wars.</p>
                  <p>As to the duties and qualifications of Souldiers, whether of Horſe or Foot, there be ſome who make ſo many of them, that if Princes keep none in their ſervice but ſuch as quadrate with all their properties, they will make<note place="margin">Duties of Souldiers.</note> but very thin muſters. But you may take all the duties of a Souldier (as the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> did) to be three. Firſt, To give exact and perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to all the lawful commands of Superiours. Secondly, To endure the fatigue, travel, and diſcommodities of War, whether it be in Marching, or working at Trenches, Approaches, and Sieges, Hunger, thirſt, and cold, with an exemplary patience. Thirdly, In time of Battel, Skirmiſh or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, to reſolve either to overcome, or dye. But Reader, do not you ſeek<note place="margin">Not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be perfectly in any one.</note> all theſe in every Souldier, do not ſeek any of theſe exactly in every Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, nay nor in any Souldier, for you will not find them; let it be enough, if they have ſome of them in ſome degree, though not in perfection. And why may you not comprehend the two laſt Duties under the firſt of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? For he who can obey his Superiour exactly, will, when he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, endure any fatigue, and in any rencounter reſolve to be victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or periſh. And indeed, Obedience is the very life of an Army. A<note place="margin">All compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under Obedience.</note>

                  <p>WHat odds there is between a Man, arm'd both for Offence and Defence, and him who only hath Offenſive Weapons, may ſoon be underſtood, though the practice had never been ſeen. Why the ſame care is not taken now to defend mens Bodies in the time of fight, as well, and as much as of old there was; ſince the Offenſive Weapons of later times, by the help of Fire, pierce more deeply and more deadly, than any of the former ages did,<note place="margin">Defenſive Arms negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> before Gun-powder, I ſuppoſe cannot well be told. If the neglect be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Great Commanders, it were well done of Soveraign Princes and States, by their authority to order the reformation of ſo hurtful an overſight. But perhaps this reaſon will be given for it, becauſe the long and continuated marches of our Modern Armies, not only for many days, but for many weeks and months, both in the extream heat of Summer, and rainy and tempeſtuous weather of winter, require that the Souldiers ſhould be eaſed of the weight and trouble of their Defenſive Arms, that with leſs toyl they may endure and undergo thoſe marches. To which I ſhall anſwer, firſt, that<note place="margin">The Reasons why, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> we have no ſuch Marches now adays, as the Ancients, eſpecially the <hi>Romans</hi> had, and if we conſider that they in their Ambulatory March, walk'd twenty miles in five hours; and in their curſory one, twenty five; and what a vaſt deal of ground, what large and long Countreys and Regions, they traced in compleat Arms, and burthe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>'d otherwiſe, as if they had been Beaſts of Carriage, we muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blame our ſelves for not imitating them, or look upon moſt of their ſtories as pure Fables. And if our Souldiers from the time of their firſt Levy were habituated to wear at their Exerciſes and Drillings conſtantly their Armour, and accuſtom'd twice a week to march a good many miles in Arms, I mean Defenſive as well as Offenſive; ſuppoſe the firſt week five or ſix, the ſecond ſeven, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till they can march fifteen or ſixteen miles in one day, they would find it then an eaſie matter to march every day in Armour, for cuſtome is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature; but this point of Exerciſing is generally neglected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I ſay, if <hi>Ratio belli,</hi> or the preſent neceſſity of affairs requires ſuch a ſpeedy and continuated March, then ſuch an Army, as ordinarily we call a flying one, ſhould be made uſe of, conſiſting of light Horſe, Dragoons, and Musqueteers; and the heavy armed Horſe and Foot ſhould be left to march after, with as much haſte as conveniently they can; to whom the light armed in caſe of neceſſity, may eaſily make their Retreat; for to bring theſe heavy armed forward (as I told you the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> did) and then permit them to caſt away their Defenſive Arms, is to denude your ſelf of the ſtrength of your Forces and Army.</p>
                  <p>Our Modern Armies, as the ancient ones, conſiſt of heavy and light armed, as well Horſe as Foot. In the Cavalry, the Cuiraſſier is the heavy armed, and the Pike-man in the Infantry. The ſtrength of all Armies ever was, and is the Infantry, and the ſtrength of it is the heavy armed. He who is in good Armour-fights with courage, as fearing no wounds, and frightens him with whom he fights, that is not ſo well armed. Pikemen then compoſing the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy<note place="margin">Pike men the Body of the Infantry, and it of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> of the Infantry, and the men of Arms the Body of the Cavalry, ſhould be armed ſo that they may appear to an Enemy (when they come to the ſhock) as a Brazen or Iron Wall. It is true, a Batallion of Pikes, without Defenſive Arms, may, being ſerr'd together, hinder a Troop of Horſe from getting in among them; but their Heads and Bodies being naked, and having nothing on either of them to reſiſt the force of a Carabine or Piſtol-ball, (except it be a Buff-coat, and for moſt part, not that) it is not to be fancied, but a Volley of ſhot from a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97406:95"/> of Horſe ſtanding without the danger of the points of Pikes, will make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Pikemen fall, which will ſo diſorder their Body, that a ſudden Charge of Horſe will eaſily break it. This is a great defect of our Modern Militia, of which moſt Nations are now guilty; for though in all their Conſtitutions of War there is an appointment for heavy armed Horſe and Foot, yet when we ſee Batallions of Pikes, we ſee them every where naked, unleſs it be in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> where ſome, and but ſome Companies repreſent the ancient Militia; and we find an Univerſal de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ect in the Cavalry, as to the heavy armed, there being but few Curiaſſiers in many Armies, and in very many none of them at all to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p>Since the invention of Guns we find till theſe latter times all Nations did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low defenſive Arms to both Horſe and Foot, according to the nature of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that was to be required of them. The Cavalry was ordinarily divided into Curiaſſiers, and Harquebuſiers, but I ſhall ſpeak of that more fully afterward. The firſt was to be compleatly armed, Man and Horſe, and thoſe we call Men<note place="margin">Defenſive Arms for Horſemen.</note> at Arms, and the <hi>French, Gens d'Arms,</hi> which is the ſame thing. The Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſiers had a Head-piece, back and breaſt, their Horſes no arms at all. But now for moſt part the caſe is alter'd, and inſtead of Curiaſſiers we have Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſiers, and inſtead of Harquebuſiers, we have Horſemen, only arm'd of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſively. Here I muſt anſwer an Objection, which is this, if the armour for Horſemen be not Musket-proof, either the Bullet pierceth through, or beats the Iron into the Horſemans body, which is equally dangerous; and if it be proof, it is exceeding troubleſome to both man and horſe; but I anſwer that there hath been, and are at this day Arms made that are proof, and of no conſiderable weight, and it is ſuppoſed a Curiaſſier ſhould be of a ſtrong body, and ſhould ride a horſe that for heighth and ſtrength ſhould be fit for that ſervice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both he and his rider are to be employed, as I ſhall tell you afterward.</p>
                  <p>The heavy armed Foot-ſoldier, or Pikeman, ſhould have a Head-piece, a<note place="margin">For Pikemen.</note> Back and Breaſt, a Belly-piece, Taſlets for their Thighs, and Greeves for their Arms, the Armour for their Heads, Breaſts and Bellies, ſhould be Carrabine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, and that for their Backs, Piſtol-proof. But we ſhall rarely ſee a Batal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Pikes in ſuch harneſs, and no wonder, ſince the Pike it ſelf is not now uſed ſo much as it hath been, and ſtill ſhould be, of which I ſhall ſpeak at length in its proper place. But here it will be fit that I ſpeak of the ſupine careleſneſs and inexcuſable inadvertency of Officers and Commanders, in their Levies, who take no notice to make a difference of thoſe who are to carry Muskets and Pikes, diſtributing them promiſcuouſly to the ſtronger and the weaker; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, without all queſtion, the talleſt, biggeſt, and ſtrongeſt ſhould be order'd to carry Pikes, that they may the better endure the weight of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Arms; nay, which is worſe, I have known Muskets given to thoſe of the biggeſt ſtature, and Pikes to the unworthieſt and ſillieſt of the Company, as if he who is not worthy to carry a Musket were ſufficient to carry a Pike, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have I ſeen this abuſe redreſſed, though often complain'd of to Generals; ſo much have I ſeen a Pike, the Prince of Weapons, diſparaged.</p>
                  <p>Many have thought it fit to give Musketeers ſome defenſive Arms, as a Head,<note place="margin">For Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers.</note> Back and Breaſt-piece, and truly I wiſh that cuſtom were continued; for though moſt of the ordinary Armour that is given them be little better than Piſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, if it be ſo good, yet it encourages them who wear it; and if, as I ſaid before, they be exercis'd, train'd, and accuſtom'd with it, it will not at all be troubleſome to them, either in their march, or on ſervice; for we find the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient light armed, eſpecially among the <hi>Romans,</hi> pretty well arm'd for defence, and from thence they had the name of light armed to diſtinguiſh them from the heavy armed Legionaries.</p>
                  <p>I think I may in this place reckon the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Feather among the defenſive<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Swediſh</hi> Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> Arms, though it doth participate of both defence and offence: It is a Stake five or ſix foot long, and about four finger thick, with a piece of ſharp Iron nail'd to each end of it; by the one it is made faſt in the ground in ſuch a manner that the other end lyeth out ſo that it may meet with the breaſt of a Horſe, whereby a Body of Musketeers is defended as with a Palliſado, againſt the rude charge of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:97406:96"/> a Squadron of Horſe, which in the mean time they gall and diſorder with their ſhot. I have ſeen them made uſe of in <hi>Germany,</hi> and before I left that War, ſaw them likewiſe worn out of uſe. When the Infantry by ſeveral Regiments or Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades are drawn up in Battel, and the Pikes and thoſe Stakes fixed in the ground, they make a delightful ſhow, repreſenting a Wood, the Pikes reſembling the tall trees, and the Stakes the ſhrubs. <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> was the firſt <hi>Swediſh</hi> King that uſed them, and it is ſaid he invented them in his Wars in <hi>Liefland</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Polonians,</hi> who far overpowered him in Horſe. I believe he uſed them firſt there, but the invention of them is of a far older date than the <hi>Swedes</hi> would have them to be; for <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, King of <hi>England,</hi> the night before the Battel of <hi>Agencourt</hi> fearing to be born down by the <hi>French</hi> Kings numerous<note place="margin">Uſed by <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth at <hi>Agen-court.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>To this kind of defenſive Arms may be reduced that invention of <hi>Rangon</hi> in<note place="margin">

                  <p>The <hi>Perſian</hi> Curiaſſiers are arm'd all over their Bodies, men and horſe, and<note place="margin">Perſian.</note> this perhaps helps them to over-maſter the <hi>Turk</hi> in Cavalry. Their Head-pieces are deckt with fair and large Plumes of Feathers, and their Targets (which they likewiſe uſe) are gilded, they have likewiſe light Horſemen, who carry Head pieces and Corſlets.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Mamalucks</hi> had the Soveraignty of <hi>Egypt, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> the<note place="margin">Mamalucks.</note> better ſort of them (for all were Horſemen) were arm'd for the Defenſive, from head to foot, man and horſe; the ſecond ſort carried large Targets wherewith they defended their Bodies in the ſhock, but before they came to it, they threw theſe Targets over their backs, till they made uſe of their Bows and Arrows.</p>

                  <p>THat there is no new thing under the Sun, and that what is, hath been, may admit of a favourable Interpretation; for time was when neither Piſtol nor Carrabine were known in the world; neither did Antiquity know Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, which is the Mother of them both, and many other Engines of fire. The Sword is a weapon that is never out of faſhion, uſed in all ages, and by<note place="margin">The Sword<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> all Nations of the world; though the difference be that ſome Horſemen uſe long, and ſome ſhort Swords. But this ſhould not be left to the choice of the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for the length of their Swords ſhould be limited to them by the Prince or State they ſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Few tell us whether the Swords of the Horſemen they write of, were for cutting, or for thruſting, or for both, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Swords were. The <hi>Perſians, Turks, Ruſſians, Polonians,</hi> and <hi>Hungarians,</hi> for moſt part wear Scimiters and Shables, which being crooked, ſerve only for ſhearing, and not at all for ſtabbing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monluc</hi> in the firſt Book of his firſt Tome, ſays, that in the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, about a hundred and forty years ago, the <hi>French Gens d'Arms</hi> carried broad Swords, which were ſo well edged, that they could cut through Sleeves and Caps of Male. The <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> uſed conſtantly broad Swords, for if we believe ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtories, a Rapier is ſo new a Weapon in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that it is not yet above one hundred years old. In the time of the late Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in <hi>England</hi> long Rapiers were uſed for a while, and then laid aſide. The <hi>German</hi> Horſemen uſe Swords fit both to ſlaſh and thruſt. <hi>John Pety<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> in that place mention'd in the laſt Chapter, ſays, The Eſtates of <hi>Holland</hi> order'd their Horſemen to carry ſhort Swords according to ſuch a length appointed for that purpoſe. It were to be wiſh'd that if Horſemen be obliged by their capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to furniſh themſelves with Swords, that their Officers would ſee them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of better than ordinarily moſt of them carry, which are ſuch as may be well enough reſiſted by either a good Felt, or a Buff-coat.</p>
                  <p>A Mace is an ancient weapon for a Horſeman, neither was it out of uſe long<note place="margin">The Mace.</note> after the invention of Hand-guns for we read of them frequently uſed by moſt Nations an hundred years ago. And certainly in a Medley they may be more ſerviceable than Swords; for when they were guided by a ſtrong arm, we find the party ſtruck with them, was either fell'd from his horſe, or having his Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece beat cloſe to his head, was made reel in his Saddle, with his blood running plentifully out of his noſe.</p>
                  <p>The Lance was the Horſemans weapon, wherewith he charged; neither do I<note place="margin">The Lance.</note> find that any Nation wanted it, long after the invention of the Piſtol. Whether the Lance be laid aſide as uſeleſs in <hi>Germany, England, Scotland, France, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> by the command of ſeveral Princes, or only worn out by time, I know not; but that it is not uſed in theſe places, is certain enough. And truly I wonder why it ſhould not now rather be uſed when the nakedneſs of mens breaſts without defenſive Arms, renders them more obnoxious to the ſtroke or puſh of a Lance than in former times, when few or no Horſemen were to be ſeen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Corſlet. I ſhall not doubt but there be ſtrong reaſons (though I know them not) why our <hi>European</hi> Generals for moſt part have abandon'd the uſe of the Lance, yet it will not be deny'd but it hath been a ſerviceable weapon hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:97406:97"/> even ſince Gun-powder, and all manner of Guns were found out. I ſhall<note place="margin">The Lance made uſeleſs by many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> give but one inſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at that memorable Battel of <hi>Dreux</hi> fought about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ago, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and Admiral <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> who conducted the Proteſtant Army by the reiterated Charges of their men of Arms with Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, after ſtrong oppoſition broke the great Batallion of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> which was compoſed of Pikemen, and was thought Invincible, and kill'd on the place ſeventeen of their Captains. After the death of the Marſhal St. <hi>Andre,</hi> and the taking of the great Conſtable <hi>Montmorancy,</hi> two of the <hi>French</hi> Kings Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals; the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was likewiſe made Priſoner by the Royal party, and the Admiral forced out of the field by the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and his Cavalry.</p>
                  <p>The Admiral rallies, and that night propoſed to his <hi>German Reuters,</hi> (who had each of them a Caſe of Piſtols, and many of them Carrabines) to march back and fall on the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> then both weary and ſecure. But though that <hi>German</hi> Body of Horſe was whole and intire, yet did the Commanders of it<note place="margin">A very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſage.</note> remonſtrate to the Admiral, that it was impoſſible for them to break the <hi>French</hi> Batallion of Foot which had kept the Field with the Duke; and I pray you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the reaſon they gave for it, Becauſe, ſaid they, we have no Lances, which are only proper for that, for the <hi>French</hi> men at Arms who had with Lances broke the <hi>Switzers,</hi> were then diſſipated, or over-wearied, and all their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces broken. If this be true, it would ſeem that the manner of the Milice then, and the Milice now, are very different, though both Modern. A Cavalry then arm'd with Lances acknowledged to be able to break an arm'd Batallion of Foot, whereof it gave a perfect demonſtration; and a Cavalry then arm'd of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſively with Carrabine, Piſtol and Sword, and not without defenſive Arms, declares it ſelf uncapable for it. And now the Carrabiners or Harquebuſiers are thought only proper for Rencounters, and the Lanciers are laid aſide as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
                  <p>But the Lance meets with better uſage from other Nations, even to this hour.<note place="margin">

He adds, that theſe Arms are bought by the <hi>Turks</hi> at exceſſive rates: but truly I think it was no good po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to ſuffer them to be ſold at any rate to ſo dangerous an enemy, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant a neighbour; but perhaps no inhibition would ſerve the turn, for <hi>Auri ſacra fames</hi> hearkens to no Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John Petyt</hi> tells us in the foremention'd place that the General Eſtates of the<note place="margin">The <hi>Hollander</hi> rejects the Lance.</note> United Provinces in the year 1599, forbad their Cavalry to make uſe any more of the Lance; but I find in <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> the uſe of it was retain'd in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armies by Archduke <hi>Albert,</hi> and Marquis <hi>Spinola,</hi> in the year 1612, after the Truce with the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> But the States commanded their Horſemen to wear Coats above their Armour; theſe Coats according to the quality of him or them who wore them, were fine, rich, and gliſtering, and are ordinarily called Coats of Arms. The <hi>Grecians</hi> call'd them <hi>Ephaeſtries,</hi> and the <hi>Romans, Chlamides.</hi> But now ſince few men are armed for the Defenſive, few need Coats of Arms.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients made uſe of Bow and Arrow on horſeback, and ſo in later<note place="margin">Archers on Horſeback.</note> times have the <hi>Walacbians</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvanians,</hi> and ſo did the <hi>French</hi> till the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Hand guns made them uſeleſs, and yet with them Horſemen arm'd with Piſtols, are ſtill called Archers.</p>
                  <p>An hundred years ago the <hi>French</hi> Archers who attended the <hi>Gens d'Armes,</hi> carried in their hand a half Lance, and one Piſtol at their Saddle, and a Sword<note place="margin">
                        <hi>French</hi> Arms.</note> at their ſide; the Arms of the light Horſemen differ'd little from theſe. The Harquebuſiers had Swords at their ſides, and Harquebuſſes at their Saddles, the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:97406:97"/> Barrels whereof were three foot long. About ſeventy years ago the Eſtates of <hi>Holland</hi> order'd theſe Horſe-men, whom they called Carabiners, to carry<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hollanders</hi> Arms for Horſe.</note> each of them a Piece three foot long, and their other Horſe-men Piſtols at their Saddles, the Barrels whereof were two foot long. Generally now all Horſe-men, whether C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The Piſtol was invented firſt by <hi>Camillo Vitelli,</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> when <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of<note place="margin">The Piſtol when invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>

The Barrel of the Piſtol may be two foot for the longeſt, ſixteen<note place="margin">Its Barrel.</note> inches for the ſhorteſt.

In former times, as I have told you, the <hi>Velites,</hi> or light armed, were ſometimes order'd to fight in the Rear, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the Flanks, but for moſt part in the Van of the heavy armed. Now they are almoſt conſtantly embattel'd on the Flanks. Both of them have their denominations from the Arms they carry. The Defenſive Arms of the Foot, ſince the Invention of Guns, and long before it, were near upon the matter the ſame among moſt Nations, but the Offenſive hath not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly alike, ſince the noiſe of Powder, ſcarce in any Nation.</p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:97406:98"/>
                  <p>The heavy armed carried univerſally in all Modern Armies, beſides Swords<note place="margin">Long Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.</note> and Daggers, long Weapons, ſuch as Pikes, Half-Pikes, long Javelines, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans and Halberds, all comprehended by the <hi>French</hi> under the name of long <hi>Bois,</hi> or long Staves. And, as I have told you in another place, with all theſe were the Foot Batallions of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second of <hi>France</hi> provided, when he march'd into <hi>Germany</hi> againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, one hundred and twenty years ago, moſt of all which had Piſtols at their girdles. His Predeceſſor <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh, having had a ſad experience how pitifully the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bow-men had diſorder'd both his Foot and his Horſe, inſtituted alſo Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers; but thoſe, after the uſe of the Harquebuſs came to be known, threw away their Bows and Arrows.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> retain'd the uſe of the Bow much longer; and no wonder,<note place="margin">Bow.</note> they were loth to part with a Weapon, which had done them ſo great ſervice. For we find that <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth made good uſe of his Bow-men in his Wars in <hi>France,</hi> when he beſieged firſt <hi>Terou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Bow is diſtinguiſhed in the Long-bow, and the Croſs-bow, the firſt<note place="margin">The long Bow.</note> requireth a ſtrong arm either ſo by nature, or made ſo by habit, and long practice. It is, without doubt, a very ancient Weapon, and univerſally uſed by moſt, if not all Nations, Maſter <hi>Norton</hi> in his practice of Artillery thinks it was uſed before the general Deluge; his reaſon is, becauſe the Almighty gave the Rain-bow as a ſign, that he would not deſtroy mankind again with Rain, and he calls it his Bow, to diſtinguiſh it from that of Men. Since the Flood, we read of it in all Hiſtories, both Sacred and Prophane: The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> of all Nations uſed it leaſt, for it came not in requeſt with them, till the reigns of the Emperours, and before that time Bows were uſed only by their Auxiliaries, and not by themſelves, or their Allies, whatever <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſeems to ſay to the contrary, whereof I have ſpoken in another place. The Bow is now in <hi>Europe</hi> uſeleſs, and why I cannot tell, ſince it is certain enough, Arrows would do more miſchief now, than formerly they did; ſince neither Men nor Horſes are ſo well arm'd now to reſiſt them, as in former ages they uſed to be. There are ſome who bring reaſons, for bringing the<note place="margin">Reaſons for bringing back the uſe of the Bow.</note> Bow again into uſe, ſuch as theſe. Firſt, Arrows exceedingly gall Horſes, and conſequently diſorder their Squadrons, becauſe being ſo hurt, they will not be manag'd by their Riders. Secondly, A Bow-man can ſhoot many more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows than a Musketeer Bullets. Thirdly, All the Ranks of Archers, though twenty, may ſhoot their Arrows over their Leaders heads, with equal miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to an Enemy, whereas Musketeers can conveniently but deliver their ſhot by one Rank after another, or by three Ranks at moſt, by kneeling, ſtooping, and ſtanding, ſeldome practis'd, and only at a dead lift. Theſe reaſons to me are unanſwerable, and I think might weigh much with Princes, to make the half, or at leaſt a third of their <hi>Velites</hi> to be Archers, and by the bargain they might ſave much money expended on Powder and Lead: but to them and Free States belongs only the Reformation of abuſes in the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia. And therefore I ſhall ſay no more of the Long-bow, than that it hath been an Offenſive Weapon ſince Hand-guns were uſed, as well as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>The Croſs-bow requireth but little ſtrength to manage it, a Weapon much<note place="margin">The Croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow.</note> uſed in <hi>France,</hi> when Fire-guns were rare. <hi>Monluc</hi> (whom I look upon as an unqueſtionable Author) informs us, that in the beginning of the raign of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the Firſt, in a Company of two hundred <hi>French</hi> Foot, moſt of the light armed were Croſs-bow men, and there were not above ſix or ſeven Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſes among them all, and all along in his Commentaries he frequently menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Croſs-bows: In his firſt Book he tells us, how he made a Retreat, when he was but a private Captain, from ſome <hi>Imperialiſts;</hi> and he ſays, when his Croſs Bow-men had ſpent all their miſſiles, he cauſed them to draw their Swords, and hold them in their right hands, and their Croſs-bows in their left, ſo to uſe them as Targets, and in that poſture of defence, he ſays, he got off, though with ſome loſs; whereat we need not wonder.</p>

And indeed when Musketeers have ſpent their Powder, and come to blows, the Butt-end of their Musket may do an enemy more hurt than theſe deſpicable Swords, which moſt Musketeers wear at their ſides. In ſuch Medleys Knives whoſe blades are one foot long, made both for cutting and thruſting, (the haft being made to fill the bore of the Musket) will do more execution than either Sword, or Butt of Musket.</p>
                  <p>Moſt think that this Hand-gun of a Musket was never uſed till the Siege of<note place="margin">When firſt uſed.</note> 
                     <hi>Rhegium,</hi> in the year 1520, little more than a hundred and fifty years ago, and I doubt much, if it be ſo old, and aſſuredly if it be, it hath ſpent forty years of its age before it learned to ſpeak, for about the year 1560, ſome Muskets were mixed with Harquebuſſes, and but a few of them too, till practice made them ſo numerous, that no other Guns were uſed by the Foot. The longer a<note place="margin">Its length.</note> Musket is (ſo it be manageable) the better, for ſhe ſhoots the further, and the ſtronger, her Chamber being able to contain the more Powder; and experience daily teacheth what advantage a long Musket hath of a ſhort one. Fifty years ago the Calibre of the Musket was ordain'd by moſt Princes, particularly by the Eſtates of <hi>Holland</hi> to receive a Bullet, whereof ten were to be caſt of one pound of Lead; that hath not been thought convenient ſince, and therefore moſt allow twelve balls of one pound of Lead for a Musket. In the year 1657, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> agreed with five Colonels of us to furniſh our Regiments with Muskets of a bore to receive a ball, whereof fourteen ſhould go to one<note place="margin">Its Bore.</note> pound of Lead. I confeſs this bore was too ſmall for a Musket. A Musket re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the half weight of her ball in fine Powder, and two thirds of common Powder, that is one pound of fine Powder to two pounds of Lead, and two<note place="margin">Its Charge of Powder.</note> pounds of ordinary powder for three pounds of Lead.</p>
                  <p>Musket-Reſts were uſed a long time, and in ſome places are yet, to eaſe the Musketeers in diſcharging their Guns, and when they ſtood Centinel. But in the<note place="margin">Musket-Reſts are worn out.</note> late Expeditions in moſt places of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> they have been found more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome than helpful, a Musketeer in any ſudden occaſion not being well able to do his duty with Musket, Sword, and Reſt, eſpecially if you give him a <hi>Swediſh</hi> Feather to manage with them. <hi>Bockler</hi> the Engineer ſpeaks of an Inſtrument that might ſerve for both Reſt and Feather, and ſuch perhaps would be very

By this a Musketeer hath theſe advantages, he ſhall be ſure to charge with dry Powder, and that is no ſmall advantage; next, it is a more ready way to charge than the other, for he hath no more to do but to bite off a little of the Paper of his Patron, and put his Charge of Powder and Ball in at once, and then ram both home. Thirdly, his Musket ſhall have her full Charge, for it is impoſſible to loſe any of the Powder, unleſs he loſe it all, and a full Charge makes a ſtrong and a ſure ſhot. If this were try'd at home with us, as it is by ſome abroad, our Powder flasks would be ſold cheap.</p>

It were therefore good, that for the half of the Muskets (if not for them all) flint-locks were made and kept carefully by the Captain of Arms of each Company, that upon any ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or party, the half or more of the other Locks might be immediately taken off, and the flint-ones clapt on by the Gunſmith of the Company, and then there would be no danger of ſeeing burning Matches, the ſight whereof hath ruin'd many good deſigns: I ſhall give you but one inſtance for all.

It is true, they made a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome retreat, but with great loſs, and with the death of their chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, one <hi>Machichao,</hi> a Noble and ſtout Gentleman. I ſhould have told you that all the Muskets of one Army, yea under one Prince or State ſhould be of one <hi>Calibre,</hi> or bore.</p>
                  <p>There are beſides theſe I have mention'd, other Weapons for the Foot, ſuch<note place="margin">Other Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons for Foot.</note> as long Rapiers and Touks, Shables, two handed Swords, Hangmens Swords, Javelins, Morning ſtars, but moſt of theſe are rather for the defence of Towns, Forts, Trenches, Batteries and Approaches, than for the Field. And as our light armed Foot are now for moſt part armed with Sword and Musket, ſo our heavy arm'd offenſively are with Sword and Pike.</p>
                  <p>As I told you of the Musket, ſo I tell you of the Pike, the longer it is (ſo it be manageable) the more advantage it hath. In our Modern Wars it is order'd by moſt Princes and States to be eighteen foot long, yet few exceed fifteen; and if Officers be not careful to prevent it, many baſe Soldiers will cut ſome off the length of that, as I have oft ſeen it done: It were fit therefore that every Pike had the Captains name or mark at each end of it.

Thirty years ago when the War was very hot in the <hi>German</hi> Empire, between the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the Catholick League (as it was called) on the one part, and the <hi>Swede</hi> and the Evangelick Union (as they call'd it) on the other, I ſaw ſuch an univerſal contempt of the Pike that I could not admire<note place="margin">The Pike ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much neglected,</note> it enough; for though after <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi> entred <hi>Germany,</hi> Squadrons and Batallions of Pikes were to be ſeen in all Regiments and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades of both parties, and that Pikemen were ſtill accounted the Body of the Infantry, yet after his Victory at <hi>Leipſick</hi> over the Imperial forces under <hi>Tily,</hi> the Kings Marches were ſo quick in purſuance of his ſucceſſes, which followed one<note place="margin">In <hi>Germany,</hi>
                     </note> on the heels of another, and the retreats alſo of other Armies from him, were ſo ſpeedy, that firſt the Pikemans defenſive Arms were caſt away, and after them the Pike it ſelf, inſomuch that all who hereafter were levied and enrolled, called for Muskets. But notwithſtanding this, when new Regiments were levied after that great Kings death, Colonels and Captains were ever order'd to levy and arm Pikemen proportionably to the Muſquetiers; yet after they had endur'd ſome fatigue, the Pike was again caſt away, and no Soldiers but Muſquetiers were to be ſeen. Whether this was done by the ſupine negligence of the Officers, eſpecially the Colonels, or for the contempt they had of the Pike, I know not. But I am ſure that for ſome years together I have ſeen many weak Regiments compoſed meerly of Muſquetiers, without one Pikeman in any of them, and ſurely they were ſo much the weaker for that. Nor did I find long after that, that the Pike got better entertainment in other places than in <hi>Germany;</hi> for in the year 1657, after the late King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had loſt his beſt Army, he gave<note place="margin">In <hi>Denmark.</hi>

                  <p>In the firſt place he ſays, Officers chuſe the talleſt and ableſt men to carry<note place="margin" type="runSum">His firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</note> Pikes, becauſe they muſt be ſtrong to carry both them and their defenſive Arms; and this, ſays he, is a loſs to the Army to give uſeleſs Arms to men, who could uſe the Musket with more advantage; for Pikemen, ſays he, can only receive the meſſengers of death (Bullets he means) but Muſquetiers can ſend them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I anſwer, he begs the queſtion, he declares the Pike uſeleſs, and that<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> was the thing he undertook to prove. Secondly, I have already complain'd that Officers chuſe not ſo oft as they ſhould, the ableſt men for Pikes, and ſo they are very ill uſed by Mr. <hi>Lupton</hi> and me, for he complains of them for doing it, and I complain of them for omitting it. Thirdly, whereas he ſays, Pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men can only receive but not ſend the meſſengers of Death, it ſeems he thinks when Pikemen fight, they are to ſtand fixed in one place; but he ſhould have remember'd that in time of action they are no more obliged to ſtand ſtill than Muſquetiers, who are ever in action and motion; for let us ſuppoſe that in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel a Body of Muſquetiers is to fight with a Batallion of Pikes, he will grant me that both the one and the other advanceth. Now he ſaith, a Muſquet kills at the diſtance of four hundred yards, ſo doth not the Pike; let it be ſo, what then, I will grant him more, that in the advance many P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>kemen fall, and no Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; yet I hope he will grant me that theſe four hundred yards (if ſo many) may be ſoon traced by men who make haſte to come to the Charge, and even before ten ranks can orderly and ſucceſſively one after another give fire, and after that I aver, If the Muſquetiers ſtand to endure the puſh of the Pike, they are inevitably ruin'd; and if they fly, then the Pikemen have the victory. I ſtill ſuppoſe that which cannot be deny'd me, that is, that the Pikemen and Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers are of equal courage; now in a cloſe encounter what can a Muſquet do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Pike, or a naked man with a Sword againſt one in Armour? If then the Pikemen fly before they come up to the Muſquetiers, they are Cowards, and the fault is in their courage, not their weapons, if they loſe the Field; and if the Muſquetiers ſtay till the Pikemen come to them, they will find that points of Pikes bring as inexorable meſſengers of Death as Bullets do.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he tells us that nothing more diſheartens Soldiers than the certain<note place="margin" type="runSum">Second Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</note> knowledg of diſproportionable and unequal Arms; this I grant to be true, but from hence he and I draw two very different Inferences; mine is, that Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers will be ſore afraid to buckle with armed Pikemen, if the Pikemen have the courage to ſtand out a Volley or two, and it is like the Muſquetiers will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that the Pikemen will ſtand it out. But he makes another Inference, and it is this, that the Pikemen will be afraid, becauſe they know their Pikes are of no effect, and can do no execution.</p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:97406:100"/>
                  <p>Certainly he tells me news, for I thought the <hi>Grecian, German,</hi> and <hi>Switz</hi>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> Batallions of Pikes had very frequently born down all before them, and ſo had done execution; and is not this again to beg the queſtion, for he is bound to prove that the Pike can do no execution? I aſſure him I will not take his word for it. But if he mean when an enemy is put to the rout, the Pikemen being heavly armed, cannot follow the execution, I ſhall readily grant it to him; and <hi>Vegetius</hi> will tell him, that the heavy armed are like an Iron wall, which can neither run away from a Victorious enemy, nor purſue a flying one, for that is left to the Horſe and light armed Foot. But he offers to prove that Pikes can do no execution by an inſtance, which I pray you hear and obſerve. There hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd a tumult between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Switzers</hi> in the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer, when he lay before <hi>Schenckſconce,</hi> the <hi>Switzers</hi> went to arms, and being in Battel preſented their Pikes; here our Author is not aſham'd to ſay, that two <hi>Engliſh</hi> men with Swords only, enter'd among the <hi>Switzers</hi> Pikes, and cut off (ſaith he) ſeveral of their heads (of the Pikes, I hope, not of the <hi>Switzers</hi>) and brought them away with them, the two <hi>Engliſh</hi> unhurt. If this be all true, what will it evince, but the great modeſty and patience of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and the prudence of the Officers of both Nations in appeaſing the tumult, for our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was mad if he thought that any rational Creature would be perſwaded by him to believe, that two men with Swords could affront a Body of Pikemen in such a manner, and go away ſo eaſily if the others had been pleaſed to reſent it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he ſays only three ranks of Pikes can do hurt, the reſt are uſeleſs;<note place="margin" type="runSum">Third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</note> then he adds, that what with the terror of the alarm, the confuſion of ranks by the death of ſome of their number, the time of night when the enemy may fall on, the hazard of wounding their own Commanders and Camerades, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſufficiently that the Pike can do no feats. I muſt take this argument in pieces, and anſwer it ſo. And firſt I ſay, if only three ranks of Pikes can do hurt, then Pikes can do hurt, and this contradicts his ſecond argument.</p>
                  <p>Next his aſſertion cannot be true, if what I have ſaid at length in another<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> place be true, that ſix ranks of Pikes can do hurt, or as he call it, execution. His argument, if true, would be ſtrong againſt the <hi>Grecian</hi> Embattelling ſixteen deep, and againſt his Maſters too, for I find by his Book he hath had his bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> where in his time the Foot were Marſhal'd ten deep. As to what he ſpeaks of the terror of an Alarm, I ask if that muſt frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Pikeman more than either a Horſeman or a Muſqueteer; I think leſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is better arm'd, but he ſpeaks ſtill of Pikemen as of Cowards, for what reaſon I cannot imagin. For his confuſion of ranks occaſion'd by thoſe who fall dead, he knows thoſe behind them ſhould fill up their places, and this Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers are bound to do likewiſe. Fear indeed occaſions confuſion, and he will ſtill have Pikemen more fearful than other men. Beſides, he will have them to be ill train'd, as if they durſt not hazard to charge with their Pikes, for fear of hurting either their Commanders, or their Companions. As to the time of night, when the enemy may fall on, I know not well what he means by it, unleſs it be that he thinks the darkneſs or horrour of the night ſhould put a Pikeman in greater danger than a Muſqueteer, and this I would gladly hear him or any other for him demonſtrate.</p>
                  <p>His fourth argument is, that Pikes are unfit and unſerviceable for Convoys.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to this, I ask, admit it were ſo, is it therefore not uſeful at all?<note place="margin" type="runSum">Fourth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</note> Next I ſay he is miſtaken, for many Convoys have made uſe of them, and many Convoys muſt make uſe of Pikes, according to the nature of the ground they<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> are to traverſe, open Heath, and Champain Country, or as the enemies ſtrength is fancied to be either in Foot or Horſe. Many great Convoys are compoſed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Firelocks, or Fuſees, I hope Maſter <hi>Lupton</hi> will not thence infer that Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets are uſeleſs.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, he ſays, The Muſqueteer is overtoil'd and diſcourag'd when he ſees<note place="margin" type="runSum">Fifth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</note> he muſt do the whole duty in Sallies, Skirmiſhes, Convoys, and Onſlachts (as he calls them) ſuppoſe Infalls or Surpriſals, from all which the Pikeman is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted. In anſwer to which I ask who exempted him? Truly none that I know<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> but <hi>Brancatio,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Lupton,</hi> who exempts him from all other duties, and makes him unneceſſary, nor can I divine where our Author hath learn'd this
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:97406:101"/> Diſcipline, that he offers to teach us. I have ſhewn the Pikeman is neceſſary for ſome Convoys, in all Sallies he is ſerviceable, ſometimes with his Pike, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a half Pike, or a Halbert, ſometimes a Morning Star, and ſometimes Hand granado's, with all which the Muſqueteer many times muſt do ſervice; for in the medley of a Salley his Muſquet is often an unneceſſary Weapon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be within a Parapet. As for Surprizals and Anſlachts, the Pikeman ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times may be very uſeful, and more than the Muſqueteer, unleſs he change the Lock of his Muſquet, as I told you in the laſt Chapter. As to Skirmiſhes it will be eaſily granted him, that neither the heavy armed Footman, who ſhould be the Pikeman, nor the heavy armed Horſeman, who is the Curiaſſier, are proper for them. Theſe ſervices were performed in ancient times by the <hi>Velites,</hi> and now by Muſquets, Fuſees, Fire-locks, and light Horſemen; the heavy armed ſtanding ready to ſuſtain them, and either to give or receive the Charge. Nor did I ever hear Muſqueteers make any ſuch complaints as theſe our Author is pleaſed to charge them with.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, he tells us, That in Outworks before or beſides an enemy, the Pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man<note place="margin" type="runSum">Sixth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</note> is uſeleſs, unleſs it be to ſtand Centinel; for, ſays he, the Muſqueteers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the works, and while they are furiouſly giving fire, the Pikeman is ſitting in the Trenches taking Tabaco, or telling Tales.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer, I do not remember that ever I heard a Soldier tell ſuch a tale as this of Mr. <hi>Luptons;</hi> but I know not where this man is, he is juſt now in Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, and immediately in Trenches. It ſeems they are all one with him; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not ſo, I muſt divide his argument into two parts, and give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer<note place="margin" type="runSum">Subdivided.</note> to both. If it be in Trenches or Approaches to a beſieged Fort, that the Muſque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eers are giving fire furiouſly, it muſt be either at a Sally of the enemy,<note place="margin" type="runSum">And anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and then ſure the Pikeman is neither ſitting, nor idle; or it is when a Battery is a making near the Counterſcarp, or that the Zap is begun there, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed both Cannon and Muſque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſhould fire furiouſly upon both Curtains and flanks of the Wall, that from thence thoſe who work may be as little diſturbed as may be, and at that time the Pikeman is buſie working with a Spade, Shovel, or Mattock in his hand, or is carefully attending to give obedience to what elſe he is commanded to do; perhaps to receive the Sally of an enemy.</p>
                  <p>In the next place I come to Mr. <hi>Luptons</hi> Outworks, and he muſt mean the Pike is uſeleſs, either when an Outwork is ſtorm'd, or when it is defended from a Storm. If the firſt, the Pike is more neceſſary than any Fire-gun, after thoſe who carry them, come to the aſcending or mounting the work, and this is obvious to ſenſe. If the ſecond, when an enemy is coming on to the Storm, it is the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers part to give fire to keep him off, and chace him away, but the enemy being already at the foot of the work, and mounting, the Muſquet is uſeleſs except from flanks, and the Pik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>man then with ſtones, and Hand-granado's doth the ſervice till the enemy be within puſh of Pike, and then ſure the Pike is not uſeleſs. But he ſays a Pike is too long a weapon for this ſervice. To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which I ſhall tell you, that Outworks (whereof Mr. <hi>Lupton</hi> ſpeaks confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) are Tenailles, Ravelines, Half-moons, Crown-works, and Horn-works, and for the defence of theſe, ordinarily there are other weapons than either Pike or Muſquet, ſuch are Hand-granado's, Stones, Halberts, Partiſans, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Stars, two handed and hangmans Swords, which are ſtanding ready with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the work, that when the Pike cannot be made uſe of, the Pikeman and Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteer both may make uſe of them, or any of them. And if none of theſe weapons be in the work, a Pikeman may very ſoon make a Half-Pike of his long Pike, which is a weapon much commended by Mr. <hi>Lupton.</hi> But there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for that either, for in theſe Outworks I have ſpoke of, a Pikeman may with much eaſe ſtand on the Rampart, and griping his Pike either at half or quarter length, tumble down an enemy dead or alive from the top of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and not cut his Pike at all. And becauſe our Author may mean Redoubts and Batteries which are made at Sieges, (for truly I do not well know where to find him) I ſay the Muſqueteers ſtanding on the foot banks of theſe, and doing their work, the Pikemen may ſtand in the body of the Redoubt or Battery, and kill or throw over any enemy that is on the head of the Parapet. As a Corollary to this ſixth argument, our Author tells us of a Scout that was loſt at the Siege of <hi>Stoad,</hi> where the half of the Soldiers were Pikemen, to whom he attributes
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:97406:101"/> the loſs, I ſuppoſe he means by Scout, ſome Poſt, and why may not I ſay, the other half of the Defendants, who were Musketeers occaſion'd the loſs, and not the Pike-men; but becauſe I know not what he means, I ſhall grant him all he ſays, and yet aver, that the particular overſight of Pike-men, will never conclude the Pike univerſally uſeleſs.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, he ſays, Pike-men cannot make a Retreat, for, ſaith he, an<note place="margin" type="runSum">Seventh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</note> Enemy will ſend Horſe-men and Musketeers againſt them, who will kill them all, and never come near them. To anſwer this I muſt tell him, that here,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer'd.</note> and in moſt of his arguments he preſuppoſeth ſtill a Body of Pikes ſubſiſting of it ſelf, without either Horſe-men or Fire-men; which alters the queſtion, and this is a ſpeculative notion of his; for that which I defend is, that Pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are neceſſary in an Army, and the ſtrength and body of an Army, not that they are the only neceſſary members of an Army; I never meant that, and that which he undertook to prove is, that they are not at all neceſſary. And here he mentions General <hi>Morgans</hi> Retreat with ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Regiments, from the long line in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Verdun,</hi> in which, he informs us, that the buſineſs was not perform'd by the Pikes. I ſhall not here ſpeak of the nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats, reſerving that Diſcourſe to another place; but becauſe I have travers'd moſt of that ground oftner than once, I ſhall tell my Reader, that <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the Fourth, King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> having made an unproſperous War againſt <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second, retir'd himſelf to his Dutchy of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <hi>Morgan</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</note> 
                     <hi>Morgan</hi> was forc'd by the Imperial Lieutenant General <hi>Tili,</hi> to retire from the long line, to a place called <hi>Burg,</hi> within four <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles of <hi>Bremen;</hi> this place being but pitifully fortified, gave him only time to breath, and leaving ſome men in it, (who were given for loſt) the <hi>Engliſh</hi> General march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards <hi>Bremerford,</hi> a ſtrong Caſtle, and a Paſs, twelve <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles from <hi>Burg: Tili</hi> purſues, and in the purſuit kills and takes many <hi>Engliſh.</hi> At <hi>Bremerford, Morgan</hi> reſts but little, yet it being a Paſs, it caſt <hi>Tili</hi> ſo far behind, that <hi>Morgan</hi> with ſome more loſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; got into the Town of <hi>Stead</hi> with the groſs of his Army: Here he is beſieg'd by <hi>Tili,</hi> which he gallantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, till for want of ſuccours, he yielded the place on honourable conditions. Now what doth all this militate againſt the uſe of the Pike? Nothing that I know of. Mr. <hi>Lupton</hi> ſays, the Pikes perform'd not the Retreat; I grant, not alone; neither did the Musketeers, but both did together; and in moſt of that ground the Pikes could not but be very ſerviceable againſt the Imperial Horſe. He ſays, many Musketeers were loſt, I believe him; and ſo were many Pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and who knows not, that in Retreats, both Pike-men and Musketeers muſt be left behind, and given for loſt; for they are the true <hi>Enfans perdus?</hi> There is no wiſe Patient, but will chuſe rather to ſuffer his Arm or Leg to be cut off, rather than loſe his whole Body, and better ſave a part of an Army than loſe all. And in that place our Author takes occaſion to inſtance ſome (as he thinks) diſadvantages that <hi>Morgan</hi> had by his Pike-men; I ſhall not contradict him, but ſhall tell him for all that, that when that General re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Holland,</hi> to the ſervice of his old Maſters the Eſtates, I never heard that he offer'd to adviſe the then Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to baniſh the Pike, as an unneceſſary Weapon out of his Army; or if he did, he prevail'd as little with him, as Mr. <hi>Lupton</hi> did with the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> to do the like, to whom he dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated this Book, which I now endeavour to examine.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, he ſays, Pike-men are not able to reſiſt a charge of Horſe. And<note place="margin" type="runSum">Eighth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</note> why ſo? Truly, if they cannot do that, I agree they are uſeleſs. Becauſe, ſaith he, the Horſe-men may ſtand one hundred and twenty yards diſtance from them, and beſtow both their Piſtol and Carabine ſhot upon them, and be in no danger of their Pikes: I anſwer, firſt, If Horſe-men come no<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> nearer Pike-men than one hundred and twenty yards, their Piſtols will do them little hurt. Secondly, This argument preſuppoſeth once more a Batallion of Pikes, without either Fire-men or Horſe-men, and therefore it is of no force. Thirdly, It preſuppoſeth that the Pike-men are obliged to ſtand-ſtill, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all the Horſe-mens ſhot, and never move. But I muſt add, that while the Horſe-men are firing, if the Pike-men advance upon them, it will undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably produce one of theſe three effects, either it will neceſſitate the Horſe-men to charge through the Foot, which they cannot do without loſs, if they do it at
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97406:102"/> all, and ſo they will neither kill, nor rout the Pike-men at one hundred and twenty yards diſtance; or it will force the Horſe-men to ſtand ſtill, which will be a greater danger and loſs; or it will make them quit the field, the greateſt loſs of all. By quitting the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ld, I mean, the Horſe men muſt either fly or caragol, by either of which the Pike-men are maſters of that ground the Horſe ſtood on, till another Squadron of Horſe advance againſt them, and endeavour to remove them from it, who perhaps may have the ſame ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, he ſays, The arming a Pike-man (he ſuppoſeth with Defenſive as<note place="margin" type="runSum">Ninth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</note> well as Offenſive Arms) is a great deal more expenſive to the Prince or State, than the arming a Musketeer; for he ſaith, a Musketeer may be compleatly armed for twenty two or twenty four ſhilling Sterling, a Pike-man not under thirty five. But this is a ſuperfluous argument, for if he once demonſtrate<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> the uſeleſneſs of the Pike, it ſhall be readily granted him, that neither Prince no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> State ſhould beſtow any thing for arming a Pike-man. But if a Pike be ſtill found neceſſary, then it will be an ill piece of frugality in either Prince or State to ſave that money that ſhould arm Pike-men.</p>
                  <p>His tenth argument he frames, by telling us how exceedingly troubleſome<note place="margin" type="runSum">Tenth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</note> and burthenſome a Pike with Defenſive Arms are, and how in time of exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive heat, a Pike-man on a march, is impriſon'd in his Arms, whereas a Musketeer with a great deal of liberty is free and open to the air. In anſwer to which, firſt obſerve, that the Musketeer hath not always reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> for doing all the duty (as Mr. <hi>Lupton</hi> maintain'd in his fifth argument) for here the Pike-man endureth the heat of the day. Secondly, If this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman had liv'd with the Ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and with many Princes ſince their time, he had (if they would have been rul'd by him) ſav'd them a great deal of money, and had given their beſt Souldiers a great deal of eaſe, for he had made all their Infantries to conſiſt of <hi>Velites,</hi> or light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed.</p>
                  <p>After all theſe arguments, Mr. <hi>Lupton</hi> ſhews us, that one <hi>Bran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But unleſs <hi>Brancatio</hi> give better reaſon for his opinion than Mr. <hi>Lupton</hi> hath done, his judgement ſhall be of no authority with me, and therefore, I muſt confeſs, that I am none of his wiſe Commanders.

                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:97406:102"/> Gentlemen are Maſters. I ſhall very briefly run through the quotations he cites out of this <hi>Italian</hi> man of War.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> (ſays he) was ruin'd and overthrown in <hi>Africk,</hi> becauſe<note place="margin" type="runSum">Firſt.</note> he had Squadrons of Pikes. But by his favour he was overthrown, becauſe neither his Pike-men nor Harquebuſiers were rightly Order'd, Train'd, nor Commanded.</p>
                  <p>Next, he ſays, <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth of <hi>France</hi> was the firſt that brought Pikes<note place="margin" type="runSum">Second.</note> into <hi>Italy.</hi> Indeed, there were Pikes in <hi>Italy</hi> before <hi>France</hi> was called <hi>France,</hi> and if that <hi>French</hi> King brought them firſt there, what loſt he by it? He tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd it, took and conquer'd the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> and return'd to <hi>France,</hi> and made his paſſage good at <hi>Fornuovo,</hi> in ſpite of all <hi>Italy</hi> then ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died againſt him, and, no doubt, his <hi>Switzers</hi> did him good ſervice, and <hi>Brancatio</hi> knew they were armed with Pikes, as to their Offenſive Arms.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he ſays, The <hi>Turk</hi> theſe forty years by paſt (reckon them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin<note place="margin" type="runSum">Third.</note> at the year 1540, and to continue till 1580) hath been Victorious over the <hi>Chriſtians, Sempre in Ongaria</hi> (ſo writes Mr. <hi>Lupton</hi>) only becauſe great Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions of Pikes, both of the <hi>Switzer</hi> and <hi>High Dutch</hi> Nation were oppos'd to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Troops of Horſe, well arm'd with Piſtol and Harquebuſs. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, firſt <hi>Brancatio</hi> his aſſertion is falſe, for the <hi>Turk</hi> was ſometimes beaten in <hi>Hungary</hi> in the time of theſe forty years, and this Mr. <hi>Lupton</hi> might have learned, by peruſing <hi>Knolles</hi> his Hiſtory, if he could light upon no better. Next I ſay, If Pikes could not reſiſt the <hi>Turks</hi> Cavalry, Harq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiers on foot (of which <hi>Brancatio</hi> would have all his Infantry to conſiſt) would have done it much leſs. But what a ridiculous thing is it to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the loſs of all Battels to one cauſe, ſince Armies may be undone and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by a thouſand ſeveral occaſions? What can either <hi>Brancatio</hi> or Mr. <hi>Lupton</hi> ſay againſt it, if I aver, that when ever the <hi>Turks</hi> were beaten (and beaten ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they were) it was, becauſe they had no Pike men to reſiſt the charge of a ſtout and hardy Cavalry?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he avers, That <hi>John Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxe</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Piter</hi>
                     <note place="margin" type="runSum">Fourth.</note> 
                     <hi>Strozzi</hi> in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> were both beaten, becauſe of the multitude of their Pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. To the firſt I anſwer, I do not remember that <hi>Sleidan</hi> gives any ſuch reaſon for his misfortune, neither did ever that Prince fight a juſt Battel with the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, moſt of whoſe Infantry conſiſted of Pike-men, as well as that of the Elector of <hi>Saxe</hi> did. To the ſecond of <hi>Strozzi,</hi> I ſay, he was routed, becauſe he made his Retreat in the day time, in view of a powerful Enemy, contrary to the advice given him by Marſhal <hi>Monluc.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, he ſays, The Battel of <hi>Cereſole</hi> gives a good proof of the weakneſs<note place="margin" type="runSum">Fifth.</note> of the Pike-mens ſervice, and the Battels of <hi>Dreux</hi> and <hi>Moncounter</hi> prov'd fatal (ſays he) to their Leaders, who were deſpis'd by their Enemies, becauſe their Foot conſiſted moſt of Pikes.

Another Imperial Batallion of Pikes, ſome <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſome <hi>Germans,</hi> fought with a great Body of <hi>Griſons</hi> belonging to the <hi>French,</hi> and beat it out of the Field, and thereafter fought with the <hi>Gaſcone</hi> Batallion of Pikes, where both parties ſtood to it valiantly, inſomuch that the <hi>Duc d'Anguien,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> General, ſeeing his <hi>Griſons</hi> overthrown, and his <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi> ſo ſhrewdly put to it, deſpair'd of the Victory. In this charge of the Imperial Pikes and the <hi>Gaſcons,</hi> almoſt all the Leaders fell at the firſt ſhock, but in the mean time there came a Batallion of <hi>Switzer</hi> Pikes, and charged the Imperial Pikes in the flank, and notwithſtanding they had to do with two ſtout and redoubted Enemies; one in the Van, and another in the Flank, yet did they keep their Ranks, and the Field too, after all the Harquebuſiers on foot, and all their Cavalry, with <hi>Guaſt</hi> himſelf (wounded as he was) had
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:97406:103"/> fled; and then, (and not till then) they caſt down their Arms, and cry'd for Quarter, which the <hi>Switzers</hi> gave them ſparingly enough. At this Charge was Marſhal <hi>Monluc</hi> on foot in the Head of the <hi>Gaſcons</hi> with a Pike in his hand, and he it is that gives us this relation. Will any man ſay that the Imperial Pikemen loſt this Battel to the Emperour? I ſuppoſe none but <hi>Brancatio</hi> and Maſter <hi>Lupton.</hi>

                     <hi>Moncounter</hi> was loſt for many reaſons too tedious to inſert here, whereof the great number of Pikes was none. And what a madneſs is it in theſe two Antipike-men to ſpeak of <hi>Dreux,</hi> for there they who loſt the honour of the<note place="margin">Battel of <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Theſe are <hi>Brancatio</hi> his Inſtances to prove the inſufficiency of the Pike, and what little reaſon Mr. <hi>Lupton</hi> had to make uſe of them upon the others authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is cleared, I hope by my anſwers, which I thought fit to give, leſt I might have ſeem'd to have undervalued Mr. <hi>Lupton,</hi> as <hi>Terduzzi</hi> hath done his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman <hi>Brancatio,</hi> who deigns not almoſt to afford one of his Arguments a reply.</p>
                  <p>It reſts now that I give an anſwer to both of them, who draw an argument againſt the Pike, becauſe the <hi>Turk</hi> uſeth it not, but rejecteth it as unſerviceable.

But I confeſs it is his vanity to ſay ſo, for the ſtaff which many of his men carry is rather a Javelin than a Pike. But next I aver, that the Grand Signiors want of Pikes is a defect in his Militia, which no Prince or State is bound to imitate. And aſſuredly if <hi>Selimus</hi> his Cannon had not terrified the <hi>Perſian</hi> Horſes in the <hi>Cald<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>They both knew that it is a capricious humour to take away a thing that hath been uſed, unleſs there be reaſons given either againſt the thing it ſelf, or the bad uſe of it, and this both of them think they have done, how ſufficiently, let the Reader judg; yet they have not done all, unleſs they give us ſomething in the room of the Pike, ſince they have taken it from us.

                  <p>

But <hi>Brancatio</hi> tells us not in his whole Book what this invention is, but keeps it up as a ſecret, as that (to uſe his own words) which deſerves only to be whiſper'd in the ear of ſome great Prince. I am afraid he never met with that Prince in his life-time who courted him for that ſecret, and therefore it is more than probable, the ſecret hath dy'd with him. <hi>Terduzzi</hi> tells us that after he had read this in <hi>Brancatio</hi> his Book, he troubled his brain two or three nights in conjecturing what this invention or ſecret might be. At firſt he imagin'd it muſt be a Machine, made with flanks for defence of the Muſqueteer, and to move ſome way or other, as the Muſqueteers advanced or retired, and ſo to his thinking ſhould be a moving, or ambulatory Citadel. But he found he had not hit right when he read in <hi>Brancatio</hi> that the invention is a moſt eaſie thing to make, but moſt difficult to imitate, unleſs the order of it be explain'd by the Author himſelf; and withal he calls it in the ſingular Number a piece of Armour; now <hi>Brancatio</hi> acknowledgeth no Arms but Sword or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſſe for Foot, hence <hi>Terduzzi</hi> concludes, the invention muſt be ſome kind<note place="margin">Cannot be well conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured.</note> of Defenſive arms, and yet no great Engine or Machine. While <hi>Terduzzi</hi> is thus puzled, an <hi>Italian</hi> Gentleman told him, that <hi>Brancatio</hi> had ſhow'd him one of them, and ſaid it was a Pike with a certain Iron-triangle in the middle of it, which being caſt on the ground any way, always one of the angles ſhould ſtand up, but when the Pike was fix'd, all the three angles ſtood in the air; which when <hi>Terduzzi</hi> had learned, he look'd on it as ſo frivolous a piece of folly,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97406:104"/> that he neither troubled himſelf nor us, with any further diſcourſe about it. Could this Triangle (be it never ſo great) be any thing elſe than one of our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throps; with theſe it ſeems <hi>Brancatio</hi> was to environ his Firemen, for he ſays his invention was only to defend the circumference: whether the Muſqueteers were to carry it, or ſome other appointed for it, we know not, and many more Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities of that great ſecret muſt we want.</p>
                  <p>Maſter <hi>Lupton</hi> is not altogether ſo ſqueamiſh as <hi>Brancatio,</hi> (though we ſhall<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Luptons</hi> Muſquet and Half-Pike, one weapon,</note> preſently find him reſerv'd enough) for he tells us that inſtead of both Muſquet and Pike he would have a thing which is both a Muſquet and half Pik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſerve the Infantry. He much commends this piece, and praiſeth the Inventer of it exceſſively, but he gives us no perfect deſcription of it, at leaſt not ſuch a one as can make me who never ſaw it, apprehend it aright. He calls it a Muſquet and Half-pike; if ſo, then two weapons: but for moſt part he calls it a weapon in the ſingular number, and therefore not two weapons. He tells us, by this wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Muſqueteers are ſafe within the Barricado of their Steel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Palliſado's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſo he calls it. By this the weapon ſhould be ſharp at both ends, and ſhould be uſed as the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Feather; and if ſo, it will make but one weapon, and the Muſquet will make another. He ſays, this weapon may be uſed as a Muſquet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reſt; but if it have no more uſe than that, experience will make it uſeleſs. And at length he aſſures u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this weapon, the Muſquet-half-Pike, will ſave a great deal of Treaſure ſpent by Princes on Pikes, Head-pieces, Backs and Breaſts. He told us of ſuch ſtuff before. But good God! can a Barricado of Half-pikes defend a mans head and body ſo well from a ſhot, as a Head-piece, or a Corſlet can? And to conclude, he directs all who deſire to know this new weapon to go to the Artillery-Garden at <hi>London,</hi> where they may be ſatisfied in all their Curioſities. But I humbly conceive the knowledg of a weapon, which he crys up to be of ſo general a good, and can bring ſo univerſal an advantage to Princes and States, ſhould not have been confin'd within ſo narrow a plot of<note place="margin">Should not be made a Secret.</note> ground as the Artillery or Military Garden. And truly I think that either the Author of that invention, or at leaſt Maſter <hi>Lupton</hi> was oblig'd in charity to have communicated it to the <hi>Hungarians, Tranſylvanians, Polonians,</hi> and <hi>Croa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> to defend themſelves by it from the Hereditary Enemy of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and particularly to the <hi>Germans</hi> to obviate thereby the inconveniences and diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which follow the great number of their Pikes, the uſe whereof Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Lupton</hi> hath condemned.</p>
                  <p>Now, though all along this Chapter I have ſhewn but ſmall inclination to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with Mr. <hi>Lupton,</hi> for the laying aſide the Pike, yet in the cloſe of his Book,<note place="margin">Soldiers ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed and train'd with both Muſquet and Pike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> and this diſcourſe, we ſhall be good friends; for he deſires if the Pike be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together abandon'd, that all who carry it may be taught the uſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Muſquet likewiſe: and this ſhall be my hearty deſire likewiſe, provided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that all Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers may be taught the uſe of the Pike alſo, for I conceive it to be very fit, that every Soldier be ſo train'd, that he may as occaſion offers, be ready to make uſe of both weapons. And for this I hope no diſcreet Commander will fall out with either Maſter <hi>Lupton,</hi> or me.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of Gunpowder, Artillery, its General, and Train.</head>
                  <p>IF the <hi>Chinois</hi> had the uſe of Guns twelve or thirteen hundred years before<note place="margin">Guns in <hi>China,</hi>
                     </note> the <hi>Europeans</hi> knew what a thing a Gun was, as ſome fancy; then they had Gunpowder alſo at that time, for without this, Guns were uſeleſs. They talk of a King of <hi>China,</hi> who being a great Enchanter, had a familiar Spirit, by whoſe help he invented Gunpowder and Artillery, by the help of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he defeated the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who had grievouſly afflicted him; and this King, they ſay, liv'd not long after our Saviours Incarnation. If the uſe of Artillery in that Country be of ſo old a date, I think the Natives ſhould long e're now have attain'd to ſuch a perfection of Gunnery, that thereby they might have defended themſelves in their late Wars with theſe ſame <hi>Tartarians,</hi> better than to have let them make a full conqueſt of their Kingdom; neither do I remember that the Jeſuit who writes the Hiſtory of that War, ſpeaks much of Ordnance. <hi>Curtius</hi> in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Great <hi>Alexander,</hi> gives occaſion to ſome to imagin that in his time (and that was ſome ages before the days of the Enchanting King of <hi>China</hi>) ſome of the <hi>Indians</hi> knew the uſe of Fire-guns; for he ſays that that daring<note place="margin">And in <hi>India<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     </note> Prince was diſſwaded from the Siege of a Town in <hi>India,</hi> becauſe the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of it defended themſelves againſt their enemies with Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from Heaven. And indeed nothing reſembles theſe more than the fire and noiſe of Powder from a Gun. But how ſoon ſoever men had the knowledg of this Art in thoſe remote Countries, it is the general opinion that in <hi>Europe</hi> it was neither known nor heard of till in the year of God 1300, a Monk in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> one <hi>Barthold Swarts</hi> (which in that language ſignifies Black) having for ſome<note place="margin">The Inventer of Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </note> uſe or other mixt ſome Sulphur and Niter together in a Mortar, a ſpark of fire falling accidentally in the mixture, blew it up with a crack immediately; the curious Friar ſearching narrowly into the cauſe thereof, by little and little found out Gunpowder, the Mother of all Fire-Engines and Works. To the Monks Invention infinite additions have been made ſince.</p>
                  <p>I will not at all amuſe my ſelf here with the needleſs diſputes of ſome, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this invention be deſtructive to mankind or not, ſince we read of many more men kill'd in Battels and Sieges before the noiſe of it was heard, than have been ſince. I ſhall only ſay that never any thing was invented before it that offer'd<note place="margin">Its admirable force.</note> ſo great violence to Nature, and yet is a ready ſervant and agent of Nature, it being able to make the heavieſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bodies, ſtones, houſes, and walls aſcend in an inſtant, and waters ſuddenly to leave their habitations in the bowels of the earth, and appear on the ſurface of it; and all this perhaps, to avoid ſomething<note place="margin">Inſtanced,</note> which nature doth more abhor.

                     </note> not) by ſome miſchance or inadvertency (as was conjectur'd) of him who was intruſted with a Magazine of Ammunition in a Tower upon the wall, the Powder was fired, which in the twinckling of an eye blew the Tower into the air, from the very foundation, level'd all the houſes of the neareſt ſtreets with the ground, kill'd many people, and mutilated more; the place where the Tower ſtood was not to be known, nor one ſtone to be ſeen of it, but in their
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:97406:105"/> room a Pool full of water ſuddenly ſummon'd from the bowels of the Earth. This blaſt made many houſes at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> (where I then was) ſhake fearfully, and that is ſix <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles from <hi>Delft.</hi> But <hi>John Petyt</hi> in his Hiſtory of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> writes, that a Magazine of Powder having been blown up at <hi>Mechline,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">At <hi>Mechline.</hi>
                     </note> in the time of the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>'s Government, made a whole Town ſhake, which was four <hi>Dutch</hi> Leagues, that is twelve <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles diſtant from <hi>Mechline.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The materials of which Powder is compoſed, are three, Saltpeter, Coal,<note place="margin">Materials of Powder.</note> and Sulphur. The firſt is called by Gunners, the Soul; the ſecond, the Body; and the third, the life of Powder. I ſhall not trouble my Reader with a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Saltpeter, or of its nature, which is the ſubject of ſome Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal contemplation, as having exactly the qualities of all the four Elements in it, and that it is the Quinteſſence of qualities. It is hot and dry, and ſo eaſie to be fired. It can be made up to a hard ſtone, ſo it is earth; yet diſſolve it, (which is eaſily done) and put it in a veſſel, it will cool Wine in the heat of Summer, ſo it is water. It grows in Subterraneous places, Caves, Caverns, Vaults, and<note place="margin">Natural Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter.</note> old ruinous walls, ſo it ſeems a ſullen, dull, and humid air is the father of it. But this natural Niter would not make ſo generally a loud noiſe over all the world, if it were not mightily helped by art, and therefore it is cultivated, nouriſhed, and invited to grow in Mud-walls, Loom-floors, Cellars, Dove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and Stables, the dung of Beaſts, eſpecially that of Hogs (if the floor be rightly water'd with Saltpeter, well order'd, produceth good Saltpeter. How theſe floors ſhould be prepar'd, preſerv'd, and uſed, and how oft pared, how<note place="margin">Artificial Saltpeter.</note> the Saltpeter ſhould be put in half-tubs, one above another, the one (wherein the Saltpeter is) fill'd with water, the other without water, and after that how it ſhould be boil'd and skim'd, and put in Braſs-pans and coolers till it congeal, and how thereafter it is refined, is ſuperfluous here to ſet down; it is neither my work, nor is it neceſſary for every Soldier to learn, but thoſe who will, may<note place="margin">Brimſtone.</note> read it in ſeveral Authors. The ſecond material of Powder is Brimſtone, which muſt be well cleanſed and purged; and the third is Charcoal, of wood made<note place="margin">Charcoal.</note> firſt clean from the bark and knots; the wood that is ſaid to be propereſt for it, is that of young Hazel, Elder, Willow, and Birch. Theſe three Materials muſt be throughly mixed and incorporated, for therein conſiſts much of the eſſence and force of Powder. Theſe three muſt be wrought together in a Horſe or Water-mill, or in a Mortar with Peſtles, and while it is a working, care muſt be taken to keep it moiſt.</p>
                  <p>Though all agree that the mixture and incorporation of theſe three Materials makes Powder, yet all agree not of the quantity of each of theſe Materials. And for theſe diſagreeing opinions it is that Princes and States ſet down their own rules for the compoſition of Powder, and ſo it is fitting they ſhould. This is a general rule that the Powder is the fineſt, quickeſt, and of greateſt efficacy that<note place="margin">Several kinds of Powder.</note> hath moſt Saltpeter, and that Saltpeter which is moſt refined, gives the greateſt perfection. Gunners generally divide Powder into three kinds; firſt, that which hath the allowance of one pound of Brimſtone, and one pound of Coal for four or five pounds of Saltpeter, and that is ordinarily called Cannon-powder. The ſecond hath one pound of Brimſtone, and one pound of Coal for ſix pounds of Saltpeter, this they ſay is for Muſquets. The third is the fineſt, and hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight pounds of Niter for one pound of Sulphur, and one pound of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal; this is for birding, for fowling-pieces, or if you will for Piſtols. Powder, for fear of its miſchief muſt be kept in upper rooms, but in dry and warm pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for age and moiſture corrupts it, and renders it improper for any uſe, but it may be again renewed by an addition of Saltpeter.</p>
                  <p>The Gunners Art is a neceſſary Appendix of the Modern Art of War, but not neceſſary for every Soldier to learn, yet the more he knoweth of it, the perfecter Soldier he is: I ſhall ſpeak but of a few things of Artillery, which I think are convenient (for neceſſary I ſay they are not) for moſt Officers and Commanders in the War to know, leaving the Art in its intire compaſs to the taught by thoſe ingenious perſons, who profeſs it, wherein I have no skill, and profeſs as little.</p>
                  <p>Pieces of Ordnance that ſhoot in a direct line (for I ſpeak not of Pot-pieces<note place="margin">Three ſorts of Guns.</note> or Mortars which caſt their ſhots in crooked and oblique lines) are either of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97406:105"/> Leather, of Iron, or of Copper. Theſe Guns which are called Leather-Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,<note place="margin">Leather,</note> have Copper under the Leather, and are made with great art, and are light to carry, which is the greateſt advantage they have. Iron-Guns are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted better than the Leather ones, but experience hath taught us that they<note place="margin">Iron,</note> are not ſo good for many uſes as thoſe of Copper. It is true, they are not ſo coſtly by far, neither do they burſt ſo readily; and ſome think the firing them, makes them firmer and faſter.</p>
                  <p>In the caſting Copper-Guns the Founders differ in the quantity of Bell-metal<note place="margin">Copper,</note> with it, ſome allowing more, ſome leſs; and <hi>Bockler</hi> the Engineer informs us, that now the <hi>Germans</hi> allow no Bell-metal at all, but for every eight pound of Copper, one pound of rough Tin; their reaſon for this is, they have found by experience, that Bell-metal makes the Piece brittle, and ſubject to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Bell-metal.</note> and Tin makes it hard. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> allow both Bell-metal and Tin. And ſome allow alſo a mixture of Latten and Lead.</p>
                  <p>Time and Art hath brought Powder to have a greater force than it had in its Infancy: The Saltpeter being more artificially refined, the Sulphur better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,<note place="margin">Powder bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter now than a 150 or 200 years ago.</note> and the Coals of more proper wood, and better burnt, the Powder now being corned, which then it was not. This change of Powder hath occaſion'd a very great alteration in the fortification of Ordnance; for Powder having now a double or a treble force more than when it was firſt found out, a Piece requires a proportionable fortification of her metal, to reſiſt the violence of the Powder. As by example, an hundred and fifty years ago, and upward, or rather two hundred, Founders allowed for a Cannon, or Demi-Cannon, 80 pound<note place="margin">Therefore the Fortification of Ordnance muſt be the ſtronger.</note> of metal for every pound of their ſhot; by which account a Piece that ſhot a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of 48 pound weight, did but weigh in mettal 3840 pound, whereas now, and ſixty years ago too, ſhe weighs with the <hi>Germans</hi> 9000 pound, which will be above 187 pound of metal for every pound of the Bullet. But in all the ſorts of Culve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines there is a ſtronger fortification required than in Cannon, in regard they being of a greater length, they are able proportionably to receive in their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers more Powder than the Cannon, and therefore muſt be better fortified. After the firſt practice of Guns, a Culverine that ſhot 16 pound of Iron had but a 100 pound of metal allow'd for every pound of her ſhot, and ſo ſhe weighed but then 1600 pound but now and long before this, ſhe weighs 4300 pound, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently hath the allowance of near 270 pound of metal, for every pound of her ſhot for ſmaller Ordnance in times of old, 150 pound of metal was allowed for every pound of their ſhot, now above 300, or near 400.</p>
                  <p>How the Moulds for founding Cannon ſhould be made, of what earth, what<note place="margin">Gunners to look carefully to the defects of Guns.</note> defects a Gun may receive from a faulty Mould, or from the melting the metal, and running it in the Moulds, what overplus of metal is allowed, which the <hi>German</hi> Founders call the Wolf; how a Gun in founding comes to be weaker of one ſide than the other; how ſhe gets chinks, flaws, and honeycombs, and how Gunners ought to be careful to try their Guns, if they have either theſe or any other defects, and how they ſhall mend them, belongs properly to Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to diſcourſe of, from whom the Courteous Reader may eaſily learn them.</p>
                  <p>There are three Fortifications of Ordnance, the ordinary fortified, the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened,<note place="margin">Several Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of Ordnance.</note> that is leſs than the ordinary, and the re-inforced, which is the double fortified. All Pieces are to be more ſtrongly fortified at the Touch-hole and Muſle and Trunions, than in the other parts of them. The Trunions equibal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the Piece, and on them ſhe is mounted and imbaſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Bore which goeth from the Muſle to the Touch-hole, is called the Cylinder or Concave, it is alſo called the Soul of the Piece. And hence, when a Piece is equally bored, and hath no more metal on one ſide than another, Gunners uſe to ſay, her Soul lyeth right in her Body. So much of the Concave as containeth Powder, Bullet, and Wad, is called the Charged Cylinder, or Chamber, the Reſt, the vacant Cylinder, or guide of the ſhot. The Touch-hole at Sallies is often nail'd, and<note place="margin">The names of the ſeveral parts of a Piece.</note> therefore Gunners ought to be skilful to know how to unnall them, and there be ſeveral ways for it, yet often none of them prevails, and therefore they are forc'd to bore a new Touch-hole, which will coſt them ſome hours labour. The reſt of the parts of a Piece not yet nam'd, are the Pommel, call'd alſo the Caſcabel, the Breech, the Viſier, or Baſe-ring, the Trunion-ring, the re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97406:106"/> ring, the Coronice ring, which is alſo call'd the Aſtragal; the Neck; and the Muſle-ring, which is alſo called the Freeze: Theſe denominations a Piece hath from a Column or Pillar, which a Piece reſembles, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> tells us in his practice of Artillery, and can be more eaſily demonſtrated by the Finger to the Reader, than intelligibly deſcrib'd.</p>
                  <p>Great Guns, or pieces of Ordnance, take frequently their denominations from the Inventers, or from Beaſts and Birds, whom for their ſwiftneſs, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and cruelty, they ſeem to repreſent. And though the word <hi>Cannon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cannon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> be generally now taken for all manner of Ordnance, yet properly it is that Piece which is ordain'd for battering of Walls, Towers, and Caſtles, and Ships; the <hi>French</hi> call them <hi>Battemurs,</hi> and the <hi>Germans, Maurbrechern,</hi> both which ſignifie Batter-walls. But there is a difference of founding this piece, among the <hi>French, Germans,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The <hi>Sieur de Preiſſac</hi> allows no more<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Cannon.</note> weight of metal for a <hi>French</hi> whole Cannon, or <hi>Battemur,</hi> than five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred pound, the Bullet to weigh about thirty four pound (that will be one hundred ſixty four pound of Metal for every pound of the Bullet) ſhe muſt have eighteen pound of Powder, and is more than ten foot long. The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> divide their whole Cannon (which they call <hi>Carthaun</hi>) into the Heavier and the Lighter. The firſt weighs in Metal nine thouſand pound, and ſhoots a Bullet of forty eight pound of Iron, for which ſhe takes twenty four pound of fine, and thirty two pound of common Powder. The lighter <hi>Carthaun</hi> weighs ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand four hundred in Metal, and ſhoots about forty two or forty three pound of Iron, the half of fine, and two thirds of common Powder. They both ſhoot alike far, to wit, one thouſand ordinary paces point blank, and at random ſix thouſand ſteps: Three <hi>Italian</hi> miles, ſays <hi>Bockler,</hi> which ſeems to be very far, eſpecially the firſt. But the <hi>Germans</hi> of a long time have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born the uſe of the heavier <hi>Carthaun,</hi> and have founded none of them, they being found too chargeable and expenſive, too heavy and troubleſome to draw,<note place="margin">The <hi>German</hi> heavy whole Cannon laid aſide.</note> and more deſtructive to Batteries, Bulwarks, and Walls, on which they ſtand, than uſeful, being ſhe breaks, tears, and ſhakes in pieces the ſtrongeſt Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mures, Defences, and Embraſures, that can be made for her: And therefore they are now thought more fit to ſtand on Walls, or in Arſenals for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than for uſe: The lighter <hi>Carthaun</hi> either for Offence or Defence, at<note place="margin">The Lighter ſtill uſed.</note> Sieges doing as much ſervice, and not ſo much hurt as the greater. And if this be true, we may eaſily obſerve, what great trouble and almoſt inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable difficulties the Great Turk's Gunners meet with in managing theſe exceſſively heavy pieces of his, the Metal whereof he carries about with him on Camels backs, or in his Souldiers Knapſacks. And though I believe many<note place="margin">

The <hi>Germans</hi> have their half <hi>Carthaun,</hi> which ſhoot twenty four pound of Bullets, their quarter <hi>Carthaun</hi> of twelve, and their Demi-quarter <hi>Carthaun,</hi> which ſhoot ſix pound of Iron. And for moſt part that Nation gives the denomination of their Guns from the weight of the Bullet they ſhoot, as a four and twentieth pounder, a twelfth, a ſixth, and a three pounder: The Cannon, or Battering Ordnance, is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> into Cannon Royal, whole Cannon, and Demi-Cannon.<note place="margin">

The whole Cannon weighs ſeven thouſand pound of Metal, and ſhoots a Bullet of thirty eight, thirty nine, or forty pound. The Demi-Cannon weighs about ſix thouſand pound, and ſhoots a Bullet of twenty eight or thirty pound. All of them will take the half of the weight of their Bullet of fine, and two parts of ordinary Powder, and may take much more, if they be reinforced. Theſe three ſeveral Guns are called Cannons of eight, Cannons of ſeven, and Cannons of ſix; ſuppoſe Inches, as being ſo many Inches high of the Diameter of their Bores. For moſt part all Cannon, properly ſo called, are not above eighteen or nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Diameters of their bores in length.</p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:97406:106"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gunners do accurately divide all kind of Ordnance into four<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Engliſh</hi> Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all Ordnance.</note> kinds. Each whereof is ſub-divided into ſeveral ſorts, according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral bores. The four kinds are, the Cannon, the Culverine, the Pierior, and the Mortar. Of the Cannon I have ſpoke already: Of the other three I ſhall ſpeak a little.</p>
                  <p>The Culverin is longer in her chaſe than the Cannon, and therefore ſhoots<note place="margin">The Culve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verine,</note> further, becauſe ſhe is able to receive more Powder proportionably in her Chamber, I ſay, proportionably to her Bullet; as by example, a Cannon that ſhoots thirty two pound of Iron, will take but ſixteen pound of fine Powder, and that is but half the weight of her Bullet: But a Culverin that ſhoots a Bullet of ſixteen pound weight, will take eleven or twelve pound of fine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and that is three parts of four of her ſhot: The reaſon is, becauſe the Cannon (as I ſaid before) is but about eighteen Diameters of her bore in her length, whereas the whole Culverin will be twenty eight, thirty, or thirty two diameters of her bore in length: And if a Culverin be reinforced, a Gunner may give her the full weight of her Bullet in fine Powder, and neither put himſelf nor her in hazard.</p>
                  <p>The Culverin is ſub-divided, into whole, and half, or Demi-Culverin, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,<note place="margin">Subdivided into ſeveral ſorts.</note> Minion, Falconet, Rabinet, and Baſe Culverine. How high every one of theſe are in their bores, how many Diameters of their bores in length, of what weight their Bullets are, what each of themſelves weigheth in Metal, belongs properly to Gunners, from whom thoſe who are deſirous, may learn theſe particulars, or may find them in ſeveral Authors. Only take theſe few general obſervations. Firſt, That all thoſe ſorts of Culverins take pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably<note place="margin">Obſervations concerning them all.

As by example, the Minion ſhoots but a Bullet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> three pound and a half, ſhe takes two pound and a half of Powder, and ſhoots her Ball at random ſeven thouſand ordinary paces or ſteps, and that is one thouſand ſteps further than the Cannon can caſt her Bullet. Secondly obſerve, that no<note place="margin">Second.</note> general rule can be given for the quantity of Powder for all Guns, but for all Guns of one ſort there may; ſome requiring half, ſome two thirds, ſome three parts, and ſome the full, or near the full weight of their Bullet. Thirdly, obſerve, that all theſe ſorts of Culverines muſt be more ſtrongly fortified in<note place="margin">Third.</note> their Metals, than the Cannon or Battering-pieces are, ſome of them having two hundred and fifty, ſome three hundred, and ſome of them three hundred and fifty pound of Metal for every pound weight of their Bullet. Whereas the Cannon takes but ſome one hundred and thirty, ſome one hundred and forty, ſome one hundred and ſixty, or at moſt one hundred and eighty pound in their Metal for every pound of their ſhot; the reaſon is, becauſe they proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly take more Powder than the Cannon, and that is now double and treble of more ſtrength and efficacy, than it was in the Infancy of Gunnery. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, obſerve, the more ponderous and heavy the Bullet is, ſo it be expell'd with<note place="margin">Fourth.</note> a due proportion of Powder, it ſhakes the more the batter'd place, provided that place be within the range of the Piece, and therefore the Cannon ſhakes more than the Culverine, though it pierce not ſo deep, if the Culverine have her due loading: Hence it is, that in Batteries Culverins and Demi-Culverins are uſed to ſhoot croſs wiſe, or to flank, to cut away that which the Cannon hath ſhaken.</p>
                  <p>The Third kind of Ordnance is the Stone-caſter, which the <hi>French</hi> call<note place="margin">Stone-caſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

They are caſt and ordain'd to ſhoot Stones, yet may ſhoot either Lead or iron, if ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged with Powder. They are handſome Pieces, and very like Cannon, or Pieces of Battery, the longeſt of them will be but eight diameters of the heighth of their bore; they are not ſtrongly fortified in their Metal, neither need they be, for they require not much Powder, and hence they are light to carry: Being duly loaden, they ſerve well enough to defend a breach, or the Port of a Town; they are good againſt Troops or Companies in the Field, and can commit Murther enough with ſmall expence, for they ſave abundance of Iron, and very much Powder.</p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:97406:107"/>
                  <p>The fourth kind of Ordnance, is the Mortar, under which comprehend Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces,<note place="margin">Mortar.</note> Square Murtherers, Tortles, and Petards. The Pot-piece ſhoots Granado's, Fireballs, and Stones. Theſe Mortars are of ſeveral and very far different greatneſſes, for ſome of them ſhoot but five, ſome ſix, ſome eight<note place="margin">Its Uſe.</note> pounds, others 300, 350, and 400 pound. They are only uſeful at Sieges, and at them they can ſerve both the Aſſailants and Defendants. The beſieged uſe them for ſhooting in the Batteries and Approaches of the Enemy, to ruin their Works, deſtroy their Men, burn their Ammunition; and by their Comet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like light, while they are in the air to diſcern where they are working. The Beſiegers uſe them to terrifie and annoy the Defendants, to burn their Houſes and Magazines with Granado's, or break them down with ſtones, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times will be of that huge weight that ſcarce a double Vault can reſiſt them. The operation of the Mortar is (as I ſaid before) altogether in oblique and crooked lines. Thoſe Gunners that are appointed to overſee them, had need to be skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful (the Art being difficult) for Granado's are very expenſive, and therefore muſt not be caſt away, yet I have ſeen as many (yea a great deal more) miſs, than hit the mark.</p>
                  <p>Bullets for any kind of Ordnance or Fire-Guns, may be of any metal you pleaſe, yea of Gold or Silver; the firſt is too coſtly; the ſecond ſome fancy to<note place="margin">Silver Bullets.</note> be able to pierce ſuch as are (by ſome black art or other) hard, or Bullet-proof. But to charge a perſon that is Bullet-proof, with a Silver-ball, to me ſeems to be like the Aſſaulting an Inchanted Caſtle. The Bullets which are ordinarily uſed, are threefold, Stone, Lead, and Iron. Of the Stone I have ſpoke; Lead-Bullets<note place="margin">Leaden Bullets.</note> are for all Hand-guns, but are not fit for Ordnance, except in caſe of neceſſity, which ſeldom arriveth. They weigh a third more than Iron, and ſo are coſtlier; they pierce not ſo far into an Earthen-wall as the Iron ones, and in ſtone-walls they batter themſelves out in breadth, without doing much hurt to the wall.

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> bullets are of two kinds, maſſie ones, and thoſe that are empty<note place="margin">Iron Bullets.</note> or hollow within. The empty are called Granado's, and are filled with ſuch<note place="margin">Hollow Iron Bullets, or Granado's.</note> ſtuff as the Engineer or Gunner thinks effectual for the buſineſs or errand on which he intends to ſend them. The maſſie Iron-bullet ſhould be exactly round, and Gunners ought to be ſure that they fit the bores of their ſeveral Pieces, for if the Bullet be too great, and ſtick in the vacant Cylinder, it hazards in the diſcharge, the burſting the Piece; and if too little, it is impoſſible for any Cannoneer to make a juſt ſhot with it, they uſe to help the ſmallneſs of the Bullet by tying Hemp, Flax, Hay, or Straw about it, for all Bullets muſt be a little leſs than the bore of the Piece, for which they are made. And therefore it was long a general rule to make all Bullets for Ordnance one fourth part of<note place="margin">Maſſie Bullets of Iron.</note> an inch lower in its Diameter, than the height of the bore of the Piece. But this is now condemned by Gunners as an error, becauſe they think for a Falcon, or other ſmall Pieces, the fourth part of an Inch is too great an abatement, and for either a Culverine or Cannon, it is too little. <hi>Bockler</hi> tells me that they agree now that the twentieth part of the Diameter of the bore of all Pieces, is a reaſonable abatement for their Bullets. There be alſo Chains, Chained Bullets, and Cartridges ſhot out of Pieces of Ordnance. The firſt at Sea-ſervice, and all of the other two in the fields againſt Troops, or Companies either of Horſe or Foot.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall forbear to ſay any more of great Ordnance, leaving the reſt to the Gunners art, which all Soldiers are not obliged to learn: Only I cannot omit to tell my Reader, that notwithſtanding all I have ſaid, there is an Hiſtory extant of that Siege which the famous Marquis <hi>Spinola</hi> form'd and maintain'd at <hi>Breda</hi> in the years 1625, and 1626, written originally in <hi>Latin,</hi> and approv'd by the ſaid Marquis, and thereafter tranſlated into ſeveral Languages; in which we are told that during the time of the Siege, <hi>Philip</hi> Count of <hi>Mansfield</hi> went to<note place="margin">Count <hi>Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> his rare Invention of Guns, at the Siege of <hi>Breda.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and there by his great art and induſtry founded forty Braſs-Guns, and twenty three Murtherers, for ſo our Hiſtorian calls them; thirty of theſe ſhot Iron Bullets of ſix pound weight, all the reſt ſhot twenty five pound. The metal of every one of the ſix pounders weighed no more but a 180 pound, and thoſe of twenty five Bullet, weighed no more but 750 pound. If you will calculate this, you will find that theſe Pieces had juſt thirty pound of metal (and no more) allow'd for every pound of their Bullet: this was a weak fortification; for we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:97406:107"/> 
                     <hi>Spinola</hi> wanted not for Powder of the beſt ſort. The Author adds that theſe new Pieces ſhot their Bullets further than the old ones did, and required but the third part of Powder formerly allowed for Pieces of their Bores. He adds alſo, which he needed not, that the leſſer new Guns were drawn by two Horſes, and the greater by four; for it is certain, the lighter the Piece is, the fewer Horſes, Men or Oxen it will need to draw it. This Invention of Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> hath been aſſuredly as to Ordnance, the beſt and moſt profitable theſe three by-paſt ages could boaſt of, both to ſave expence, and to further expedition. But this good man tells us not how the Earl did all this, only he informs us, that he knew ſo well to boil the melted metal in the fire, that though it had leſs thickneſs, yet it had equal hardneſs with the greater Guns; but I thought that not only the hardneſs, but the thickneſs of the metal ſhould reſiſt the violence of the Powder, and therefore Pieces are more fortified at the Touch-hole, Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and Muſle, than at any place elſe. But not having heard that this rare Invention was practiſed afterward in all theſe long and bloody Wars, which have been in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> ſince that famous Siege, nor read any thing of it in thoſe who write of that Art, I ſhall ſuſpend my belief of the thing till I hear that it is approv'd by Judicious Gunners.</p>
                  <p>An indifferent Train of Artillery, eſpecially if there be battering Guns in it,<note place="margin">The great trouble and retardment a Train of Artillery brings to an Army,</note> their Carriages, Powder and Bullets, with all fitting Inſtruments, will require very many Horſes to draw it, which may the more eaſily be conceived if we caſt up an account how many one Piece will need.

This Piece may be diſcharged ſafely ten<note place="margin">Demonſtrated by what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for one piece of Cannon,</note> times in one hour, and conſequently in twelve hours 120 times; 120 being multiplied by thirty, (which is the weight of the Bullet) the product is 3600. You are to multiply again a 120 by 20, which (is the weight of the Powder) produceth 2400. Add 3600, and 2400 to 6000, the aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate is 12000 pound. In the next place let every Horſe be bound to draw<note place="margin">For one day only.</note> 272 pound weight, and divide 12000 by 272, you will find the Quotient 44, with a Fraction of 32; ſo you ſee forty four Horſes neceſſary to draw one Piece with Powder and Bullets needful for the ſervice of one day, without the addition of the Carriage, or of Waggons and Carts. Hence you may conclude, that a numerous Train muſt of neceſſity retard the march of an Army either in purſuing or retiring. In the firſt caſe all or moſt of it may be left with conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to follow; but in the ſecond, there is very great difficulty, and many times the endeavouring to ſave it, hath occaſion'd the loſs of Armies.</p>
                  <p>There is no doubt but Artillery ſerves to good purpoſe to make an Enemy either remove his Camp (if it be within the range of the Ordnance) or come out and fight. That it forceth Towns and Forts to yield we know; but we muſt confeſs (for all that) that few Battels have been won by Artillery; for as <hi>Monluc</hi> ſays of the Cannon, <hi>Il fait plus de peur, que du mal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> It frightens more<note place="margin">Artillery ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expenſive.</note> than it hurts. The loſs of a Train of Artillery is of exceeding great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to a Prince or a State, therefore the leſs the Train is, the expence will be the leſs, and the expedition the greater. There are ſome who in their Writings of Trains of Artillery, and other eſſential members of Armies, inſtance the Princes of <hi>Orange.</hi> But I ſay other Princes and States are not to take up their meaſures either in their Trains of Artillery, or other points of War by the Eſtates of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> in regard few or none of them (that I know) have ſuch advantages of the Situation of their Country, as thoſe Eſtates have, who by water for moſt part may tranſport their Ordnance, their Proviſions, their Munitions, their Inſtruments, and ſometimes their Soldiers, which other Princes muſt carry all by land with Horſes and Waggons, (except the men) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they have the benefit of ſome Navigable River, which ſeldom falls out.</p>
                  <p>It is not every Army that either is or can be allowed either a full Train, or yet a General of Artillery. Many of theſe called flying Armies have no Guns at all with them, and many of them have only ſome Field-pieces, which being drawn with very few Horſes, need not much obſtruct the ſpeedy march of an Army. I have known divers Armies at one time in <hi>Germany</hi> under <hi>Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> each one whereof had but a petty Train, and that order'd
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:97406:108"/> by a Colonel, or a Lieutenant-Colonel, but there was only one General of the<note place="margin">A great Train not neceſſary with every Army.</note> Artillery, who had the ſupreme Command of all the Ordnance in all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and he ſtaid conſtantly with the Felt Marſhal of the principal Army. I knew the late King of <hi>Denmark</hi> in the year 1657, have two brave Armies (tho' both unſucceſsful) the one ordain'd for the defence of <hi>Holſtein</hi> and <hi>Jutland,</hi> the other for <hi>Schonen,</hi> the Train appointed for each of them was order'd by a Colonel, and there was neither General, nor Lieutenant-General of the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance with either of them. Whether it be fit for a Prince or a free State to keep one General of the Artillery to have inſpection over all the Ordnance, all the Munitions of War, and all the Armes within that Kingdom, or Republick, or rather to intruſt ſeveral perſons with the ſeveral Magazines, ſhall not be the ſubject of this Diſcourſe. But that all Princes and States ſhould have Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, Arſenals, and Magazines, well ſtuft with all manner of Arms offenſive and defenſive, with great and ſmall Ordnance, with Powder, Match, and Ball, and all the ſeveral Materials of their Compoſition, with Mortars, Pot pieces, Petards and Granado's of all kinds, is, as I ſuppoſe a thing which will be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as neceſſary beyond all Controverſie.</p>

When the late King of <hi>Sweden</hi> invaded <hi>Poland</hi> in the year 1655, the perfidy of the <hi>Poloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> was ſuch that they deliver'd almoſt that whole Kingdom into his hands.

They alſo make within the Kingdom, greater ſtore of Arms both for offence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, than they have uſe for. I have ſeen ſome little Towns in <hi>Sweden,</hi> wherein few other Artificers were to be found, but Armourers and Gunſmiths.

                  <p>He who commands in chief over the Artillery is called by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or Maſter of the Ordnance; by the <hi>French, Grand Maiſtre del Artillerie,</hi> Great Maſter of the Artillery; by the <hi>Germans, General fetz Eugmeiſter,</hi> which is General Overſeer and Maſter of the Munitions for the Field, a term very proper, becauſe he hath not only the inſpection of the Ordnance, but of the

The reſt of his parts and abilities (which ſome require in him alone) I think he may divide among thoſe who are under his<note place="margin">His great Command.</note> command and authority, who truly are right many; as the Lieutenant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Ordnance, two Colonels, if not more, Lieutenant-Colonels, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and Gentlemen of the Ordnance, Maſter Gunner, and all inferior Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Conductors, and Comptrollers, Engineers, the Clerk of the Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Maſter of the Mines, and Mineers under him, Maſter of the Artificial Fires, and his Conductors and Petardeers, thoſe who have a care of the Tools for Fortification, for intrenching and approaching, the Maſter of the Pioneers (in ſome Armies) and all his Pioneers; the Maſter of the Batteries, and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, for to the General of the Artilleries direction and inſpection belongs the Entrenching the Camp, the making the Approaches, Redoubts, Batteries, Zaps, Galleries, and Mines, and other works at Sieges of Towns and Caſtles. He hath alſo his own Commiſſary, Quarter-maſter, Waggon-maſter, Miniſter, and Chyrurgeon. If then you will conſider that he and all thoſe under him are to have pay and wages, and what a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I think it ſomething ſtrange to read in <hi>Bockler</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Architect, that it is of late condeſcended on by the greateſt Practitioners of Artillery in <hi>Germany,</hi> that for an Army of forty thouſand men (whereof thirty two thouſand ſhould<note place="margin">Thirty Pieces of Ordnance thought lately a ſufficient Train for an Army of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand men.</note> be foot, and eight thouſand Horſe) thirty Pieces of Ordnance are enough, either to beſiege a ſtrong place, or to attack an enemy, though never ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly lodged. For the laſt I ſhall be eaſily induced to believe it, but for the firſt part of his affirmative I know not how to reconcile it with the opinion of thoſe knowing Gunners, and experimented Captains, who formerly thought eight Cannon, ſix Culverines, and four Demi-Culverines, no more than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:97406:109"/> to make one ſufficient Breſch, whether in Courtine, or Baſtion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more in my Diſcourſe of Sieges. His thirty Pieces of Artillery he divides thus: Eight whole Cannon (which he calls <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaun</hi>) nine Demi-Cannon, ſix Quarter-Cannon, and ſeven Field pieces. The whole Cannon (for I ſuppoſe he means the lighter ſort) ſhoots a Bullet of forty pound, the Demi-Cannon twenty four pound, the Quarter Cannon ſix pound, and I ſhall be contented, that each of the ſeven Field-Pieces ſhall ſhoot three pound. But if the former opinion hold, of eighteen Guns for one Breſch, and that the Town beſieged have five Baſtions or more, as moſtly they have, <hi>Bock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> furniſheth us not with Guns enough to Braſch two of them. But let us ſee what Powder and Iron his thirty Guns will ſpend in one artificial day, that is twelve hours time; you may allow his eight whole Cannon to fire eight times<note place="margin">What Powder and Bullets thirty Guns may ſhoot in twelve hours.</note> in one hour, and at every time twenty pound of Powder for the forty pound Bullet of Iron. Multiply twelve (the number of the hours) by eight (the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the whole Cannon) the Product is ninety ſix. Now every whole Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non firing eight times in the hour, makes ninety ſix ſhot in twelve hours, and therefore ſpends three thouſand eight hundred and forty pound of Iron; for ninety ſix multiplied by forty, produceth three thouſand eight hundred and forty, for every pound of the Bullet, I allow but half Powder; to wit, for forty pound Bullet, twenty pound Powder. The whole Cannon then diſcharged eight times every hour ſpends a hundred and ſixty pound, multiply a hundred and ſixty by eight, (the number of the whole Cannon) the Product is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and eighty. Thus much Powder eight Cannons ſpend in one hour; multiply a thouſand two hundred and eighty by twelve (the number of the hours) the Product is fifteen thouſand three hundred and ſixty, ſo much Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt be allowed for eight whole Cannon to play twelve hours, and twice as much Iron, to wit, thirty thouſand ſeven hundred and twenty.</p>
                  <p>The nine Demi-Cannons ſhall fire ten times every hour, this will make ninety ſhot in one hour, multiply ninety by twelve (the number of the hours) the Product is one thouſand and eighty. You may remember we allow twenty four pound of Iron for every ſhot of a Demi-Cannon, then for one thouſand and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhot, twenty five thouſand nine hundred and twenty pound of Iron; for mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply one thouſand and eighty by twenty four, the Product is twenty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand nine hundred and twenty; ſo much Iron doth the Demi-Cannon ſpend in twelve hours, and the half ſo much Powder, is twelve thouſand nine hundred and ſixty.</p>
                  <p>The ſix Quarter-Cannon ſhouts ſeventy two pound of Iron, (to wit, each of them twelve) they may be diſcharged twelve times in one hour, and therefore the ſix are diſcharged ſeventy two times in twelve hours, and all ſix make in twelve hours time eight hundred ſixty four ſhot, multiply eight-hundred ſixty four by twelve (the weight of the Bullet) the Product is ten thouſand three hundred and ſixty eight; ſo much Iron doth theſe ſix Quarter-Cannon ſhoot in twelve times, for that you are to reckon the moiety of Powder, which is five thouſand one hundred and eighty four.</p>
                  <p>The ſeven Field Pieces (each of them ſhooting a Bullet of three pound) ſhoot at one time twenty one pound of Iron, this they may do ſafely fifteen times in one hour; multiply then twenty one by fifteen, the Product is three hundred and fifteen. Multiply three hundred &amp; fifteen by twelve (the number of the hours they are to play) the Product is three thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty, ſo much Iron do theſe ſeven Field Pieces ſhoot in twelve hours time, and the half of that in Powder, which is one thouſand eight hundred and ninety.</p>
                  <p>By this account which will be granted to be rational enough, <hi>Bocklers</hi> thirty Pieces (though far fewer than other Trains) in twelve hours time will ſpend ſeventy thouſand ſeven hundred eighty eight pound of Iron, and of Powder thirty five thouſand three hundred and ninety four. By this you may make a reaſonable good conjecture of the expence of Ammunition for great Guns.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Milton</hi> in his Poetry plays with this matter, and makes the uſe of Cannon very old, as being practiſed by <hi>Lucifer</hi> againſt the Omnipotent. See his <hi>Paradiſe Loſt.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of Muſters, and Muſter-maſters, Pay, Proviant, and Service, of Treaſurers, Commiſſaries, and Proviant-maſters, and of the Military Oath.</head>
                  <p>AFTER Foot-Soldiers are levied and armed, and Horſemen arm'd and mounted, it is fit they be Muſter'd, that it may be known whether the Colonels and Captains have raiſed their full numbers of ſufficient men, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeveral Capitulations made with the Prince or State whom they ſerve. This word Muſter, or <hi>Monſtre,</hi> ſignifieth a Show which is made by<note place="margin">Muſter-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> thoſe Officers who are appointed to view the Soldiery; thoſe with us are called Muſter-maſters, and are either General or particular. The General Muſter-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath the inſpection of the particular ones, and to him they are bound to give a particular account of their deportments, and from him they receive their directions. In all Muſters the Colonels and Captains are bound to deal uprightly and honeſtly, and to make a ſhow of none but ſuch as are really in their Regiments and Companies. The Muſter-maſters duty is to take a ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and a particular view of every mans perſon and name, (having Liſts and Rolls in his hand) of his age, of his Arms and Equipage; and if he muſter<note place="margin">Muſters,</note> Horſemen, he is to ſee that the Horſe be ſerviceable, and of ſuch a height, as is appointed by the Prince or States order, and ſuch as the ſervice requires, whether he be a Curiaſſier, or Harquebuſſier. In ſome places, eſpecially in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Muſter-maſters inquire the names of the Soldiers Parents, the Country and place of their birth, and write down the complections of their faces, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of their hair, and ſome private mark which the Muſter-maſter obſerveth. It is, and indeed ſhould be infamy to any Captain to make a falſe Muſter either of borrowed men, Horſes or Arms; and the ſame puniſhment doth the Muſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter deſerve, if he either ſubſcribe to, allow of, or connive at any ſuch jugling, for thereby the Prince is not only cheated of his money, but groſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed to his great diſadvantage, when he is made believe that he hath either more men, or more ſufficient men than really and effectively he hath. For this reaſon, and that the Captains may be hired to be honeſt, ſome allow Paſſevolants,<note place="margin">Paſſevolants, what.</note> that is, for ſuch a number of real and viſible men, ſuch a number of inviſible men, as the <hi>Swedes</hi> uſed to allow to every Company of Foot, <hi>d'en Paſvolants,</hi> whereof ſix belong'd to the Captain, two for the Lieutenant, and two for the Enſign. Every one of theſe had the allowance of half a <hi>Rix-dollar</hi> every ten days, but this cuſtom wore out, and there was reaſon for it, becauſe many Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains notwithſtanding that Indulgence, endeavour'd ſtill to keep void places in their Companies, as a mean to make their Purſes full.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Muſter-maſters by the <hi>Dutch, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Swedes</hi> are called Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,<note place="margin">Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> over whom the Commiſſary General of the Army hath the ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. This difference there is, that thoſe Commiſſaries keep the Purſe, and ſo are Pay-maſters; but our Muſter-maſters are not ſo, the paying belonging to our Treaſurers, as among the <hi>Romans</hi> it belong'd to the Queſtors. They have power to muſter as oft as they pleaſe, acquainting him firſt who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in chief, either in Field or Garriſon: And indeed in thoſe Countreys they muſter oftner than they pay.</p>
                  <p>After the firſt Muſter, the Troops and Companies get their Standards and Enſigns, and then take the Military Oath, which we call to Swear to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. I have ſpoken of the <hi>Roman</hi> Military Sacrament: This Oath we now ſpeak of is the ſame for Officers. Troopers and Souldiers ſwear, with hands lifted up to Heaven, <q rend="inline">To be faithful and loyal to their Prince, or his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,<note place="margin">Military Oath.</note> never to deſert or leave the Service without permiſſion of their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:97406:110"/> to be ſtout in time of Battel, Rencounter, Skirmiſh, or Aſſault, and rather to chuſe to dye, than deſert their Standards or Colours, never to turn their backs on an Enemy, and to reveal all Conſpiracies, Treaſons, and Mutinies, intended againſt the Prince or State, or their Generals, and other Commanders:</q> So help them God in the great day. If this Oath were punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally kept, all Battels would be ſo well fought, that there would not be ſuch a thing, as the ſlight of an Army to be ſeen or heard of in the World. After this Oath, the Articles and Laws of War ſhould be publickly and diſtinctly read, that they may know what puniſhments (for moſt Articles ſpeak more of them, than of rewards) they may expect, if they commit ſuch crimes as are there menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd. This is a thing moſt neceſſary to be done, that none may pretend Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for where there is no Law, there can be no Tranſgreſſion: Of theſe Articles I ſhall ſpeak in the next Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Being that moſt men who follow the Wars over all the World, receive wages, they juſtly deſerve the name of Mercenaries; but if you will conſider how their wages are paid, I ſuppoſe, you will rather think them Voluntaries, at leaſt very generous, for doing the greateſt part of their ſervice for nothing. It is ſaid of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> that they will not fight, unleſs they be paid duly. If other Nations were of their humour, Princes and States would be neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to agree better than they do, becauſe ſeldome would their Armies fight for them, becauſe ſeldome they are paid by them. The <hi>Baptiſt</hi> inſinuates, that Souldiers ſhould be paid their wages, becauſe he bids them <hi>be contented with their wages, and do violence to no man.</hi> But few or no Evangelick Precepts are obeyed, and this as little as any; Souldiers get not their wages, and violence is done to many men. At the firſt view, it would ſeem ſtrange, why Princes pay their Souldiery very well and duly in the time of Peace, when they have little or nothing to do with them, and very ill and very ſeldome in the time of War, when they have moſt to do with them. But the reaſon is ſoon found, they need far greater numbers in time of War than Peace, and many are not paid with ſo little money as a few are. In the Wars of <hi>Europe</hi> theſe laſt four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years and upwards (wherein his Majeſties Dominions were free, except in the late unhappy Civil War) we find that the Eſtates of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> have payed their Armies better than any other Prince or State; this makes the Mercenary Souldier run to their Service, and capacitates them to make great levies in a very ſhort time. The effects of the bad payment of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> appeared, when their King ſtood moſt in need of their ſervice ſeventy<note place="margin">Armies uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally ill paid.</note> years ago and a little upwards; and many times ſince; for that gave a riſe to thoſe terrible Mutinies, in which they poſſeſs'd themſelves of Towns, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Generals and Superiours, as if they had been Free Eſtates. This incapacitated the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters to proſecute the War againſt the new Eſtates, in which time, it is not to be thought, that either they, or the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> were idle Spectators. The moſt conſiderable Army the <hi>Sweeds</hi> had in the year after the death of their Victorious King <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> lay idle at <hi>Donaverth,</hi> loſing the time of Action, and treating for their pay. <hi>Boccalini</hi> informs us, that once the Gardiners complain'd to <hi>Apollo,</hi> that they<note place="margin">

But I think, Princes and States are to be much more admired for another ſecret art of their own, whereby they get theſe Drones to do them both laborious and hazardous ſervice, for very little Money, and at a low expence. The Pay and Wages for Officers and Souldiers of both Horſe and Foot, are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent according to the eſtabliſhments of ſeveral Princes and States. I ſhall ſpeak a little of ſome of them; for to ſpeak of all, though I could, were needleſs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>German</hi> Emperours eſtabliſhment during the time of the long War, was<note place="margin">
                        <hi>German</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour his Pay.</note> fair enough, for there was promiſed to every Colonel of Horſe 300 Dollars, to a Lieutenant-Colonel one hundred and eighty, to a Major one hundred and twenty, to a Ritmaſter one hundred, to a Lieutenant ſixty, to a Cornet fifty, beſides allowances of fodderage for ſo many Horſes, proportionably according
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:97406:110"/> to their qualities, monthly: To a Quartermaſter twenty four Dollars, to a Corporal twenty two, to a Clerk fifteen, to a Trumpeter as much, and to an Einſpanneer or Trooper twelve. The Pay for the Officers and Souldiers of Foot was much leſs: But they got not three months Pay of twelve in a whole year. But <hi>Bockler</hi> tells us, that in the year 1658. at <hi>Frankford on the Maine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pay of the Confederated <hi>German</hi> Princes, <hi>An.</hi> 1658.</note> the Electors and Princes of the Empire, who had joyn'd in a League, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are many made in that Countrey) had unanimouſly agreed upon a Pay to be given to their forces, ſo long as the League continued, (moſt of their Leagues are broke in ſhorter time than they are a making) and it was this. A Rit-maſter was to have for himſelf every month ſixty Dollars, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for ſix Horſes, which amounted to forty eight Dollars, ſo he had in all one hundred and eight Dollars monthly. But becauſe all the Officers of Horſe had allowance for ſome Horſes, beſide their own Pay, I ſhall for brevity ſet down the allowance for themſelves and Horſes together. A Lieutenant had monthly forty four Dollars, a Cornet as much; a Quarter-maſter twenty three; a Corporal twenty one; the Clerk, Trumpeter, and Chirurgeon each of them eleven; and the Smith as much; a common Trooper eight. Before I ſpeak of the Foot-pay, I ſhall premiſe, that the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> and moſt of the <hi>German</hi> Princes allow a Waggon with four Horſes, and two Saddle-Horſes for a Captain of Foot, and the like number between the Lieutenant and Enſign. The Princes then of this <hi>German</hi> League allowed for a Foot-Captain, himſelf and Horſes monthly forty eight Dollars; for a Lieutenant twenty one; for an Enſign-bearear as much; for a Serjeant ſix; for a Fourier, Furer, Captain at Arms, Clerk, Drummer, Piper, and Gentleman of the Company, each of them two Dollars, and the fourth part of one; for the common Soldier every month two Dollars.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not ſpeak here either of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> or the <hi>Swediſh</hi> pay; they being<note place="margin">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Pay,</note> much about one with this agreement, except that their allowance is a little more and greater both for the Under-officers, and the common Soldiers. The <hi>French</hi> Pay will be much about one with the <hi>Swediſh:</hi> And therefore, my Reader, if he know any thing of his Majeſties eſtabliſhment, will quickly<note place="margin">All far ſhort of his Majeſties.</note> perceive, that his Pay is greater than any of thoſe I have ſpoke of, and is better paid than all of them.</p>
                  <p>How the <hi>German</hi> Princes paid their Souldiery in their laſt ſhort War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know not, but in the long one, I am ſure, they paid very ill, and ſo did the <hi>Sweed.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bad Pay in the long <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> War.</note> Thoſe who were in Garriſon got ſometimes three, but for moſt part but two Lendings in the month, every Lending being but a little more than half a Rix-dollar, to which was added the aſſiſtance of ſome proviant Bread. Why they call this a Lending, I know not, unleſs it be to make the Souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they lend them money, when they are but paying them a part of their own. But the pooreſt witted Souldier knows well enough, that his Pay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maſters, under the notion of lending them a third part, borrow from them to a very long day, all the reſt of their Pay. This is for their Garriſons. In the Fields, they may happily deceive themſelves, whether they be Officers or Souldiers, that expect any Money, but muſt be contented with Commis Bread, till by ſome Victory, any of their Generals be enabled to quarter his Army in a plentiful Countrey, and there it is, where the common Souldiers may put themſelves in Clothes, the Officers in good equippage, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels make themſelves rich; for the <hi>German, Daniſh,</hi> and <hi>Swediſh</hi> Colonels play too often the Roytelets, and petty Kings in their ſeveral Regiments. But ſome Officers there be, who never meet with ſuch opportunities, and ſome are not dextrous enough to lay hold on ſuch occaſions when they offer themſelves; for at ſuch times, there is ſomething elſe required, than to receive Pay from the Clerk of the Company. I remember, a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-man of mine told me once, that he had ſerved the Crown of <hi>Sweden</hi> eight years, whereof he had been a Captain three, and that in all thoſe years he had never been Maſter of fourſcore Crowns at one time.</p>
                  <p>One hundred years ago, Armies were better paid than now they are, and Officers and Souldiers could tollerably well ſubſiſt, great care was then taken, by a ſeaſonable diſtribution of money to prevent Mutinies, and deſertion of the ſervice; why it is not ſo yet, perhaps want of Money may be the cauſe,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:97406:111"/> though there is now much greater ſtore of money, than was then; if Princes and States have other reaſons for it, they are not to communicate them to Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who are very improper Judges of them. I thought it ſtrange to ſee ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen<note place="margin">Too many weak Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cauſe of bad pay.</note> or ſeventeen years ago, the native <hi>Spaniards</hi> to whoſe keeping the ſtrong Citadel of <hi>Antwerp</hi> was intruſted, begging publickly in the ſtreets of that City. But I thought it a more lamentable ſight to ſee both there, and in <hi>Germany,</hi> and elſewhere, Lieutenant-Colonels, Majors, and Captains begging an Alms. In former times Regiments were thrice, four, or five times ſtronger than now they are, and conſequently Troops and Companies were for their numbers as ſtrong if not ſtronger, than now half Regiments are. Hence it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I believe there are hundreds of old men yet living, who have ſeen private Captains in higher eſteem than Colonels are now. And I ſuppoſe if Princes and States thought it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>it to follow the old way, and make their Troops and Companies three times ſtronger than now they are at their firſt levy, they might be as well ſerv'd, and ſave a vaſt exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce of Treaſure. If an army of twenty four thouſand men were to be raiſed, whereof eighteen thouſand were to be Foot, and ſix thouſand Horſe, ſix Colonels might as well now command the 18000 Foot divided into ſix Regiments, as ſix Colonels did the like fifty years ago, and four Colonels might command the ſix thouſand Horſe, divided into four Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, allowing to each one thouſand five hundred Horſe.

                  <p>Be pleaſed to ſee the truth of this inſtanced by an obſervation I made in the year 1649, after the Peace of <hi>Munſter, Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> had in her<note place="margin">Numbers of <hi>Swediſh</hi> and <hi>Heſſick</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, after the Peace of <hi>Munſter.</hi>

The <hi>Landtgrave</hi>'s a hundred and eight Troops of Cavalry ſhould have been eight thouſand ſix hundred and forty Horſe. His hundred and eight Companies of Foot ſhould have been (at a hundred and twenty ſix men a piece) twenty two thouſand ſix hundred and eighty men. Be pleaſed to add the <hi>Landtgrave</hi>'s eight thouſand ſix hundred and forty Horſe to the Queens thirty three thouſand ſix hundred, the aggregate is forty four thouſand two hundred and forty. Add the <hi>Landtgrave</hi>'s twenty two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred and eighty Foot, to the Queens ſeventy nine thouſand three hundred and eighty, both the Infantries amounted to a hundred and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and ſixty.

And I am very ſure there were not ſo few Colonels as a hundred and forty. So there might have been ſav'd the expence of the Officers of eighty Regiments, both in the time of War, and at that time too when they were to give their Officers a little ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction-money (for ſo it was called) in lie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Since Money is generally ſcarce in the Wars, in ſo much that Soldiers cannot receive their Wages duly, let us ſee what allowance of Meat and Drink (ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily called Proviant) Princes allow their Soldiery, to furniſh which every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould have a General Proviant-maſter; and truly I conceive him to be an Officer as neceſſary and uſeful, if not more, in the fields, where moſtly our Modern Armies are entertain'd with Proviant, as either a General Commiſſary, or a Treaſurer. His Charge is to provide Victuals, Corn, Fleſh, Wine, Bread and Beer; he hath the inſpection of them, and ſhould ſee them equally and proportionably divided to the Regiments according to their ſeveral ſtrengths; for which purpoſe he ſhould have all the Rolls and Liſts<note place="margin">A Proviant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> by him, which his Secretaries ſhould carefully keep. He hath no power to ſell any Proviant under what pretence ſoever, without the Generals ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Warrant. All Mills where the Army comes are under his protection, and he is obliged to protect them. He hath the ordering of all the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines for Victuals, and to him belongs the care of ſeeing the Garriſons, and fortified places ſufficiently provided with ſuch Meats and Drinks as are<note place="margin">Proviſions for fortified places.</note> moſt fit to preſerve; theſe are Corn, Grain, and Meal of ſeveral kinds, Stock-fiſh, Herrings, and all other Salted-fiſhes, Salted and Hung-fleſhes, eſpecially Beef and Bacon, Cheeſe, Butter, Almonds, Cheſnuts, and Hazel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, Wine, Beer, Malt, Honey, Vinegar, Oyl, Tabaco, Wood and Coal for Firing, and as many living Oxen, Cows, Sheep, and Swine, Hens and Turkies as can be conveniently ſed; for which purpoſe as alſo for Horſes, he is to provide Straw, Hay and Oats. This General Proviant-maſter hath under him a Lieutenant, a Secretary, a Clerk, a Smith, a Waggon-maſter, and a Waggon-maker, a Quarter-maſter, and ſome Officers who are called Directors.</p>
                  <p>There are few Princes who have not their particular eſtabliſhment for their Proviant both in Field and Garriſon, as well as for Money; the order<note place="margin">Allowance of Proviant.</note> whereof commonly is this, they allow ſo much Bread, Fleſh, Wine or Beer to every Trooper and Foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Soldier, which ordinarily is alike to both; then they allow to the Officers according to their dignities and charges, double, triple, and quadruple portions; as to an Enſign four times more than to a common Soldier, a Colonel having commonly twelve portions allow'd him. The ordinary allowance for a Soldier in the field, is daily two pound of Bread, one pound of Fleſh, or in lieu of it, one pound of Cheeſe, one pottle of Wine, or in lieu of it, two pottles of Beer. It is enough, crys the Soldiers, we deſire no more, and it is enough in conſcience. But this allowance will not laſt very long, they muſt be contented to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I have known Captains give a very great demonſtration of their patience, and their affection to their Maſters ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, by ſatisfying their appetites with water, and very coarſe bread, one whole Summer, and part of the next winter.</p>
                  <p>But they will be refreſhed when I tell them of free Quarter which Princes<note place="margin">Free Quarter, very burden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome to a Country, though never ſo well regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</note> and their Generals are many times forc'd for want of money to grant, where they can Quarter their Armies in Towns and Villages, and this proves oft the deſtruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of a Country: for though no exorbitancy be committed, and that every man both Officer and Soldier demand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o other entertainment than what is allowed by the Prince or State where they ſerve; yet when an Army cannot be Quarter'd but cloſe and near together, to prevent Infalls, Anſlachts and Surpriſal of an Enemy, it is an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to imagin what a heavy burthen theſe places bear, whom in poor mens houſes, ſix, ſeven, eight, it may be fourteen or fifteen Soldiers are lodged, for in ſuch caſes it is ordinary to quarter two thouſand Foot, or a thouſand Horſe in a little Town, where perhaps there are not above three or four hundred houſes. And withal it is very hard to get Soldiers and Horſemen kept within the limits of their Duty in theſe Quarters, after they have endured hunger, thirſt, and other hardſhips in the field. It is true; all Princes who for
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:97406:112"/> preſervation of their Armies from extream ruin, and for want of Treaſure, are neceſſitated too often to make uſe of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> free Quarter, do not only make ſtrict Laws and Ordinances, how many times a day Officers and Soldiers are to eat, and how many Diſhes every one according to his quality is to call for, but likewiſe ſet down the preciſe rates and values of the Diſhes, that the Hoſt be not obliged to do beyond thoſe limitations, yet the grievance continues heavy and great.</p>

                     <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Princes, are upon the matter with little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference all one, as thus: A Colonel is to have twelve diſhes of meat, each at the rate of the eighth part of a <hi>Dollar,</hi> ten pound of Bread, and ten meaſures of Wine. A Lieutenant Colonel, eight diſhes, eight pound of Bread, and ſix meaſures of Wine. A Major or Captain ſix diſhes of Meat, ſix pound of Bread, and ſix meaſures of Wine. A Lieutenant and Enſign, each of them four diſhes, four pound of Bread, and three meaſures of Wine. Every Serjeant three diſhes of Meat, two pound of Bread, and one meaſure and a half of Wine. Every Corporal, and every Drummer two diſhes of Meat, two pound of Bread, and one meaſure and a half of Wine. A common Soldier or Trooper ſo much Fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bread and Wine as I ſpoke of before, when I told you what Proviant was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him. If the Army be not in a Wine-Country, then all thoſe I have ſpok<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is beſides the Hay, Straw and Oats the Country is bound to furniſh to the Horſes, not only of the Cavalry, Artillery, and General Officers, but to thoſe Horſes likewiſe that belong to<note place="margin">Foderage.</note> the Infantry. And this grievance of Foderage proves many times heavier than the free quarter, all being often eaten up in a ſhort time, wherewith the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants ſhould maintain their Horſes and Beaſts. In theſe Countries where the Country-people receive a little money for what the Soldiers ſpend on their Marches in their tranſient Quarters, as for moſt part in his Majeſties Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is more tollerable than where they receive no moneys at all, though the Hoſts of both Foot and Horſe muſt be conſiderable loſers, when they get but a Two-pence or a Groat for a nights entertainment.</p>
                  <p>Service is that which every Hoſt is bound to furniſh either in Town or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try<note place="margin">Service.</note> to thoſe that are lodged with them, whether they be Officers, Troopers, or common Soldiers, whether they be on free quarter, or to pay for their Diet. Service comprehends a Bed, Lodging, Table, and Table-linnen, Fire, Salt and Vinegar. It is a grievance likewiſe, becauſe many times the Soldiers are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly extravagant in demanding more of thoſe than they need. I find in ſome Hiſtories of <hi>France,</hi> that ninety years ago or thereby, this Service was called<note place="margin">

Nor might they invite one another to their Quarters, becauſe that prov'd troubleſome to their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Landlords. But when moneys were wanting, then the Soldiers were to have free Quarter, which was ſo well regulated, that none might demand any other entertainment than what the Hoſt was pleaſed to give them, provided that was ſufficient to ſatisfie nature. And withal, five Shillings <hi>ſterling</hi> in money every month, wherewith to buy ſhoos, or other ſmall Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And truly this was a better order for free Quarter than any I have yet ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. A very eſpecial care was taken to puniſh all ſuch who tranſgreſt any of theſe Ordinances. And about that ſame time I find that the Proteſtants pay was very frugal, the Foot was paid thus: A Captain had every Month a hundred<note place="margin">Proteſtant pay eighty or ninety years ago.</note>

                  <p>THE Laws of God and Nature would not be ſufficient to keep wicked man within the bounds of his duty, if the Municipal Laws of the Land were not ſuperadded, and thoſe would ſignifie but little too, if the punitive execution of them did not follow the tranſgreſſors of them. I know not indeed why Souldiers ſhould not be governed by thoſe ſame Laws whereby other ſubjects of that ſame Prince and State are, if it be not for two reaſons: Firſt, an Army being in the field, and making no long abode in one place,<note place="margin">Reaſons for the ſever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ty of Military Laws.</note> Criminals and other guilty perſons cannot be ſo formally and legally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd before the ordinary Judges of the Land, as the conſtant Inhabitants may, eſpecially when an Army is out of a Prince his own Dominions, as many times it is. Secondly it is found not only fit but neceſſary, that more ſevere Laws be made in Camps than in Cities, for I know not by what authority, for what reaſon, or by what inſtinct men who follow the War, aſſume to themſelves a greater liberty to ſin than other Mortals do, as if the entering themſelves in a Militia, did let them looſe from all Civil bonds and tyes of humane Society, and that which in a Commonwealth is a Capital crime, were but a venial <hi>Peccadillo</hi> in an Army. That ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are better govern'd than others, is eaſily granted, and that fewer groſs crimes are committed in ſome, than in others, will not be denied, being ſome Generals are more juſt, more exact, and more ſevere than others are; and which is more than that, ſome Armies are better paid than others be; for <hi>Theoderick</hi> King of the <hi>Goths</hi> ſaid well, <hi>Diſciplinam non ſervat jejunus exercitus:</hi> A hungry Army obſerves no Diſcipline. But that the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, and ſome ſince their decay, were ſo well govern'd, and all the members of them ſo orderly, is but a dream; their terrible diſorders and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant deportments are to be ſeen in Hiſtory, and ſome of them I have touched in the beginning of my Diſcourſes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia. And if in an Army ſome offences be not inſtantly puniſht, it will be found peradventure within a few hours impoſſible to puniſh them at all. Hence it is that a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the War is not only permitted to do that which the Civil Judg may not do, but is lyable to cenſure if he does it not, as to inflict preſent death, either by his particular order, or with his own hand without formal proceſs, as in the<note place="margin">Soldiers in ſome caſes may be put to death without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</note> caſe of mutiny, to kill one in the beginning of it, and ſo to terrifie others from proſecuting it, or in the caſe of diſobedience, when the appearance or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of an enemy, will not ſuffer the Delinquent to be legally proceeded againſt, or upon a march when an enemy is either in Van, reer or flank; a Marſhal-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral may be order'd to hang all without proceſs, whom he finds at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Army without his Colone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s Paſs; and in this laſt caſe Officers may kill thoſe Soldiers that ſtragle or lag behind. But I ſhould adviſe all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders not to make themſelves <hi>Boureaus,</hi> and to be very ſparing to kill with their own hands, except in extraordinary caſes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe reaſons have given a juſt riſe to Military Laws, which ordinarily are called Articles of War, there are, or at leaſt, ſhould be as many ſeveral Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary<note place="margin">Articles of War.</note> Conſtitutions as there are Princes or States, who wage War, for every one of them hath his ſeveral Laws and Statutes, yet all or moſt agree in theſe following particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſtrict Laws are made for the obſervance of Religious Duties, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion<note place="margin">For Religion.</note> to Church-Diſcipline, and a due reſpect to be given to all Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perſons, againſt Atheiſm, Blaſphemy, Perjury, and the prophanation of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:97406:113"/> the name of God. Secondly for the maintenance of the Majeſty and Authority<note place="margin">For Loyalty.</note> of the Prince or State, in whoſe ſervice the Army is, that nothing be done or ſpoke to the diſparagement of himſelf, his Government, his Undertakings, or the Juſtice of any of his actions, under all higheſt pains. Thirdly for honour, reſpect, and obedience to be given to all ſuperior Commanders from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt<note place="margin">For Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> to the loweſt of them, and none of their Commands are to be diſputed, much leſs are they themſelves to be affronted, either by geſtures, words, or actions. But this is to be underſtood that the command be not diametrically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and prejudicial to the Prince his ſervice; but indeed ſuch commands would be ſo clear that they need no canvaſing, otherwiſe any diſobedience opens a door to reſiſtance, that uſhereth in ſedition, which often is ſupported by open rebellion. To clear which, ſuppoſe what frequently falls out, that the Governour of a well fortified, and a well provided place offers to deliver<note place="margin">Diſobedience to unlawful Commands, lawful.</note> it up to an enemy without oppoſition, thoſe under him may reſiſt ſo unjuſt and ſo baſe a command; and they not only may, but ought to reſiſt him, for the diſobedience in ſuch a caſe of the ſubaltern Officers and Soldiers is a piece of excellent ſervice done to their Maſter; and if they do it not, they are lyable to thoſe Laws of War, which for giving over a Fort in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, ſentences the Governour to an Ignominious death, the inferiour Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders to be ſhamefully caſheer'd, and the common Soldiers to be diſarm'd, and made ſerve as Pioneers to the Army; which were acts of great injuſtice, if Inferiors were bound to give a blind obedience to all the Commands of their Superiors, whatever they be, without exception. And ſuch a caſe it is, when an Officer commands thoſe under him to deſert their Poſt, whether that be in Town, Camp, Leaguer, or Field, and go over with him to the Enemy. If they do ſo, and are ever retaken, he is puniſht for his treachery, and they for their obedience to ſo illegal a command.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Articles of War are made for due and ſtrict keeping of Guards<note place="margin">For keeping ſtrict Guards, and Watches.</note> and Watches; and here (as in many other points) obſerve the ſeverity of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Law, for he who after tap-too diſchargeth any Hand gun, be it Piſtol, Musket, Fuſee, or Carrabine (unleſs againſt an enemy) or he who ſleeps on his Centinel, or deſerts it, or he who is drunk on his Watch, are all to die; theſe be crimes which the Municipal Laws of moſt Nations do not puniſh with death, yet in the Laws of War this ſeverity is thought no more than neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Laws are made againſt thoſe who ſtay behind, or ſtraggle in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary<note place="margin">Againſt ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</note> or extraordinary Marches.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Againſt Fugitives and Runnaways, either ſuch as leave their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours<note place="margin">Againſt Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naways.</note> when they are in Garriſons or Quarters, and deſert the Service under any pretence, without a Paſs, or ſuch as run away from their Colours, or their Officers in the field, in time of Skirmiſh or Battel, or ſuch who in ſtorms and aſſaults deſert their Poſts, till either they are wounded, or have made uſe of their Swords, all theſe are lyable to death, and thoſe who wound or kill any of them in their flight, in their going or running away, are not to be accountable for it.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Againſt thoſe who make any Treaty or agreement in the field<note place="margin">Againſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with an Enemy.</note> with an enemy, without the command or conſent of him who commands in chief. And here again obſerve another caſe wherein Inferiors are to refuſe obedience; the Military Law condemns a Colonel for ſuch a Treaty, and every tenth Soldier of his Regiment to die with him, for giving obedience to ſo unjuſt a command.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Againſt thoſe who ſurrender fortified places, unleſs extream ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity<note place="margin">Againſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Surrender of Forts, and ſeveral other crimes.</note> require it, of which I ſhall ſpeak in a more proper place.</p>

                  <p>Eleventhly, Againſt thoſe who ſell, play, or pawn, or change their Arms<note place="margin">Againſt ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or pawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Arms.</note> either defenſive or offenſive, whether he be a Horſeman, or a Foot-Soldier; he who doth any of theſe, is not only puniſhable, but likewiſe he who bought, won, or took them in pawn.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, Againſt falſe Muſters, whether it be of Men, Horſes, Arms,<note place="margin">Againſt falſe Muſters.</note> Saddles, or other Furniture, by theſe Articles not only thoſe who make the falſe Muſter, but all thoſe who help to make it, are puniſhable.</p>
                  <p>Thirteenthly, Againſt thoſe who detain the pay of either Horſemen, or<note place="margin">Againſt thoſe who detain the Princes Pay.</note> Foot-Soldiers, any Officer guilty of this deſerves to die. Neither if an Officer have lent money to a Soldier, may he pay himſelf, or retain in his hand what he pleaſeth, but muſt give him as much of his pay as can enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him to do his Maſters ſervice.</p>

The <hi>Swediſh</hi> Articles order a Colonel (who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to give a Paſs) to loſe his life, and to loſe his charge if he permit any under his command to go home without the Felt-marſhals knowledg.</p>
                  <p>Other abominable crimes, ſuch as Adultery, Inceſt, Sodomy, Beaſtiality,<note place="margin">Greater Crimes.</note> Parricide, are examin'd, try'd and puniſht according to the Municipal Laws of the Prince or State who is Maſter of the Army. And many ſmaller<note place="margin">Smaller faults.</note> faults are left to the cognizance, diſcretion and arbitrament of a Court of War.</p>
                  <p>A Council of War, and a Court of War, are commonly by ordinary<note place="margin">A Council of War.</note> Soldiers confounded, as if they were one thing, whereas they are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent; the firſt being compoſed of thoſe perſons whom the Prince or his General calls to conſult with concerning the managing the War, and theſe are indeed but Counſellors, and have in moſt Armies their Preſident, who is nominated by the Prince or State, they do but adviſe for the Prince or his Captain-General, have a negative voice, and retain a power to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to do what they pleaſe. A Court of War conſiſts of thoſe Officers who are call'd together to be a Jury in the examining, proceſſing, and ſentencing Delinquents; and it is twofold, a General or high Court of War, and a Regiment, or a low Court of War.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes belonging to the General Court of Wars cognizance, are<note place="margin">A General Court of War.</note> matters of Treaſon againſt the Prince or State, injuries and affronts done or offer'd to the perſon or honour of their General; differences between the Cavalry and Infantry, between one Regiment and another, between Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of one Regiment, or between Officers and Soldiers of one Regiment. To the deciſion of a General Court of War belong all Civil affairs and buſineſs, though they have been determined in the lower Courts; for in<note place="margin">Caſes to be determined by it.</note> theſe caſes Appeals are permitted to the higher Court; neither can the ſentence of the lower Court be executed, till the proceſs be fully heard in the ſuperior, if the parties concerned have appealed to it. When the buſineſs concerns the Prince or State, or that any General perſon or Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel is criminally accuſed, the General or Commander in chief of the Army is obliged to preſide himſelf. But in thoſe other caſes which I have mention'd,<note place="margin">The Preſident of it.</note> He may appoint a Lieutenant-General, or a Major-General to preſide. I know the <hi>Swedes</hi> give the Preſidency in General Courts of War, conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Auditor-General, or Judg-Marſhal, in the General or Felt-Marſhals abſence. But truly I think this is not done without ſome deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe General Officers who aſſiſt; for though upon the matter the Auditor-General orders the proceedings of the Martial Court, yet in point of honour he ſhould not preſide in a high Court of War no more than a Regiment-Auditor (in the Diſcipline of theſe ſame <hi>Swedes</hi>) preſides in a lower Court. The Aſſeſſors ſhould be twelve in number at leaſt, (for they<note place="margin">The Aſſeſſors.</note> may be, and ordinarily are more) beſides the Preſident, and in ſome places fourteen beſides the Preſident. Theſe be the General of the Artillery, the Lieutenant-General of the Army, the Generals of the Cavalry and Infantry, the Lieutenant-Generals, and Major-Generals of Horſe and Foot, the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-maſter General, and ſuch Colonels as the General, or Auditor-General thinks fit to appoint. After they are conven'd, they take their places thus: At the head of the Table, the Preſident ſits alone, upon his right hand at
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:97406:114"/> the ſide of the Table, ſits the General of the Artillery, and under him the General of the Cavalry. Upon the Preſidents left hand at the ſide of the Table, ſits the Lieutenant-General of the Army, and under him the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Foot. Under the General of the Cavalry ſits the Lieutenant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral<note place="margin">Their Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</note> of the Cavalry, and under the General of the Foot, ſits the Lieutenant-General of the Foot; and in that ſame order the Major-Generals, and next them the General Commiſſary, and General Quarter-maſter. Next them, all the Colonels who are called there, take their places according to the time they have ſerved as Colonels in that Prince or States ſervice; the right ſide of the Table (which is that on the Preſidents right hand) being more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable than the other. After they have all taken their ſeats, they riſe again, and hear an Oath read, wherein they ſwear with hands up, to be free<note place="margin">Their Oath.</note> from all malice, envy, hatred, revenge, fear, and affection, and that they ſhall judg righteouſly and impartially, according to the Laws, Conſtitutions, and Articles of War, and their own beſt judgment, and conſcience. So help them God in the great day. The Provoſt-Marſhal General is to be the Accuſer,<note place="margin">The Accuſer.</note> with the help of the Princes Prolocutor-fiſcal, and to him belongs alſo the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the ſentence.</p>
                  <p>The lower Court of War is that which is kept in the ſeveral Regiments, whether Horſe or Foot, which the Colonels, and in their abſence the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Colonels may call, when ever they think the neceſſity of their affairs<note place="margin">A Regiment Court of War.</note> require it. A Regiment Court-Marſhal may judg and determine in all cauſes, both Civil and Criminal, and of all perſons (except the three Field-Officers) within that Regiment. The Colonel preſides, in his abſence the Lieutenant-Colonel,<note place="margin">The Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> and in his the Major; or if none of theſe be preſent, the oldeſt Captain, but the Regiment-Auditor, never, nay not in the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Armies. In the Regiments of Horſe, the Colonels Aſſeſſors are his Lieutenant-Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,<note place="margin">His Aſſeſſors.</note> and Major, three Rit-maſters, as many Lieutenants, as many Cornets, and as many Corporals, or more, if the Colonel pleaſeth. In a Regiment of Foot, two Captains, two Lieutenants, two Enſigns, two Serjeants, two Furers, and two Fouriers, where ſuch Officers are allowed; where not, more of the Serjeants, and two Corporals. They may be in all more than thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,<note place="margin">Their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> but fewer they may not be. The Regiments Provoſt-Marſhal preſents the accuſed party with a Guard to the Court of War, after the members have ſworn as the General Court of Wat uſeth to do, and formally delivers<note place="margin">The Accuſer.</note> his accuſation; from this Court, there may be (as I told you before) appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">The ſentence to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the General.</note> in Civil affairs, but not in Criminals, yet no ſentence of death paſt by a lower Court of War can be executed, till the General approves of it, and ſometimes he remits the examination of it to a ſuperior Court; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he hath ground to believe that the Regiment-Court hath paſt either too rigorous, or too mild and favourable a ſentence. And this ſuperior Court call'd in ſuch caſes, is commonly call'd a Court of Error, becauſe it cognoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth<note place="margin">Court of Error.</note> of the Errors of the inferior ones. The Prince or State ſtill retains power to moderate and mitigate the ſentence of either of the Courts, or graciouſly to remit and pardon the offence; and in their abſence their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals may do the like, except in the caſes of <hi>Les Majeſty.</hi> But after the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of either the one Court, or the other, is prohounced, no man that bears charge or office in the Army is permitted to ſpeak for pardon or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation, unleſs it be Enſigns (to whom ſomething of that nature by cuſtom is indulged) and in ſome places Officers who tranſgreſs in this point are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht with the loſs of their places, and ſuch as have done ſo, may be ſure none will be ſo kind as to plead for their reſtoration.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Laws, Ordinances, and Courts of War, the ſentences of theſe Courts, and execution of theſe ſentences, makes up that part of a Militia which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily<note place="margin">Diſcipline of War.</note> is called the Diſcipline of War; for the right ordering and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting whereof, an Auditor-General, Inferior Auditors, a Marſhal-General, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Provoſts, Marſhals, and their Lieutenants, with Executioners, or Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are abſolutely neceſſary members in all Armies.</p>
                  <p>The Auditor-General is he whom we call Judg Marſhal, and whom ſome<note place="margin">Judg Marſhal.</note> call Judg-Advocate. He ought to be a grave and judicious perſon, who fears God, and hates vice, eſpecially bribery. A Lawyer he ſhould be, in regard
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:97406:114"/> moſt Articles of War have their riſe from Law, and many caſes chance to<note place="margin">His Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Duty.</note> be voided in Courts of War, where no Military article is clear, but muſt be determin'd by the Civil, or by the Municipal Law of the Prince, to whom the Army belongs, and the Judg-Marſhals duty is to inform the Court what either of theſe Laws provides in ſuch caſes. Some Princes remit the whole Juſtice of the Army ſo abſolutely to the Judg-Marſhal, that they give him power to puniſh Soldiers who tranſgreſs publick Proclamations, of himſelf, without the Colonels conſent, yea, whether he will or not. The Provoſt-Marſhal General, and all Officers of Juſtice of the Army, whatever name they bear, are to obey the Judg-Marſhals directions and orders. He may cauſe Delinquents to be apprehended, and ſend them to the Regiments to<note place="margin">His Power very great.</note> which they belong, with direction to the Colonels to call Regiment Courts of War, at which he may appoint the Provoſt-Marſhal, or his Lieutenant to be preſent, and to appeal from it in caſe any unjuſt or partial ſentence be pronounced. All complaints whether in matters Civil or Criminal uſe to be brought before him; and in many of them he hath power to give judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment himſelf without any Court, and in others he hath authority to oblige Colonels to do Juſtice, wherein if they fail, he may bring them before a General Court, to anſwer for their partiality. All differences that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Merchants, Tradeſmen, Mark-tenters and Sutlers, who are permitted to frequent the Army, or that happen between any of them, and the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Soldiers, are brought before him, and in them all (after due exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the whole fact, and witneſſes) he hath power to judg and give ſentence. He hath power to call together a General Court of War, and to call ſuch Colonels to it as he thinks fit, but herein he ſeldom acts till the General or Feltmarſhal adviſe the matter with him. Such Colonels as he cites to be Aſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and do not appear, he may fine, and by the Fiſcal exact the Fines he hath impoſes. He is bound to examine all Priſoners of War, as alſo all ſuch as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the Army, and may be ſuſpected to be ſpies. All Teſtaments, Contracts, and Obligations between party and party, are judged to be in force when they are ſigned and atteſted by him. He hath power of the Meaſures and Weights within the Army, and may order the Marſhals to ſet fitting Prices on all vendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things that are for Back or Belly. And he is to have a care that the Provoſt-Marſhals neither wrong the Soldiers, nor the Merchants, Victualers or Sutlers, and he is Judg in any difference that may ariſe between any of them.</p>
                  <p>A Provoſt-Marſhal General is by thoſe who do not well underſtand his Office,<note place="margin">A Provoſt-Marſhal-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</note> taken at beſt to be but a Jaylor, but by ſome to be a Hangman. But no Jaylor ever durſt aſſume the power which all Military Laws and Cuſtoms give a Marſhal, for he may by vertue of his Office, without any command or permiſſion of his Superiors apprehend thoſe he finds actually tranſgreſſing the Articles of War, or in any other groſs miſdemeanor, and according to the quality of the fault, either detain them Priſoners with a Guard, or yet clap them in Irons. But he<note place="margin">His Power in an Army.</note> may neither diſmiſs them, nor yet impoſe further puniſhment on them without order from either the Commander in chief of the Army, or the Judg-Marſhal General. At ſome times, and in ſome occaſſons he is permitted, yea comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to hang or ſhoot to death ſuch as he finds (in contempt of late Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) ſtragling, robbing, burning, or Plundering. And for that reaſon a Guard of Horſe is allow'd him, theſe the <hi>French</hi> call Archers. Whoſoever offers to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him in the exerciſe of his charge, be what he will, is to die for it. All Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt-Marſhals of Regiments, Troops, or Companies, whether of Horſe or Foot, are to ſwear obedience to the Commands of this Marſhal-General; and whoever pays it not, is by the command of the Auditor-General turn'd out of the Army, with the conſent of the Colonel or Captain, according as he is a Regiment or Companies Marſhal. All Marſhals of Regiments are bound when they are in the field every morning and evening to wait on the Marſhal-General to receive his directions according to Emergencies, and he who fails in either attendance or obedience, is puniſhable according to the quality of the fact. I have told you that in General Courts of War, he is the Accuſer, and is to ſee the ſentence put in execution. He is to have a ſtrict eye over his inferior Marſhals that they do their Duties uprightly and impartially, and that they permit not the Soldiers to wrong the Victualers and Sutlers, nor thoſe to wrong the Soldiers, by taking
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:97406:115"/> greater Prices, or ſelling with leſs meaſures or weights than thoſe appointed by the Auditor-General. He ought to take pains to learn what the Prices of things<note place="margin">His Duty.</note> are in theſe Towns where the Mark-tenters buy their Wine, Beer, Tobaco, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, Oyl, Bread, Bacon, and other Proviſions, that accordingly the General Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor may know with the greater juſtice to impoſe the Prices. But the truth is, the Buyers are too often abuſed, and the Prices ſet too high by the colluſion of the Provoſt-Marſhal with Sutlers, and the Sutlers bribing the Judg Marſhal. The Provoſt-Marſhal General hath a Jaylor under him, who muſt be paid by<note place="margin">His Jaylor.</note> every Priſoner his Jail-money, and if Irons be clapt on him, he muſt pay for them beſides. He is to have a pottle of Wine or Beer of every Hogſhead that is brought to the Camp by the Sutlers, and the Tongue of every Beaſt that is ſlaughter'd in it, and for theſe he agrees with the Regiment-Marſhals. The ſame power he hath in the field with an Army, the like he hath in all Garriſons, though he come to any of them but accidentally, or upon ſome emergency.</p>
                  <p>Under the Marſhal-General are Hangmen, and thoſe are the fellows who glory that all this great ſhow and parad of Juſtice, of Courts of War, of Judg-Marſhals, of Provoſt Marſhals, and Clerks, would be but a fanfare, and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing at all, if it were not for them. They avouch that they are the Pillars, the props, and ſupporters of Juſtice; for if, ſay they, the Executive part of the Law, be the life of the Law, then Hangmen, who are the true and unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable<note place="margin">Hangmen.</note> Executioners of the Law, keep life in the Law, by taking away the lives of the Breakers, contemners, and tranſgreſſors of it.</p>
                  <p>I have known another high Juſtitiary in <hi>Swediſh</hi> Armies of equal power with the Marſhal-General, for what power this laſt hath in Quarters, Garriſon or Camp, the ſame hath the other in the field on a March; he is qualified with the title of Rumor-maſter General, whether he be made uſe of in other places,<note place="margin">Rumor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter General.</note> is more than I have learned. His charge is to ride with a Guard of Horſe, and ſome Hangmen on the Van and Flanks of the Army, and in a Retreat; in the Reer, to ſave all the ſeveral Quarters and Country from being pillaged or plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, and the Country people from being wrong'd; and many times he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to uſe Summary Juſtice and execution on the offenders, in the place where they are taken, but for moſt part only to apprehend them, and deliver them over to the Marſhal General.</p>
                  <p>The Laws and Articles of War of every Prince and State ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated to all the Armies, and read over to every particular Regiment, Troop, and Company every month, or at leaſt every quarter of a year that none may have reaſon to pretend ignorance. In all Courts of War, higher or lower Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers<note place="margin">How the members of a Court of War give their ſentence.</note> of equal quality, as Major-Generals, Colonels, Majors, Captains, Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and Corporals, (after a full examination, and hearing of parties, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes) go apart by themſelves, and after ſome debate agree upon the ſentence, which he who hath the Precedency among them, whiſpers in the ear of the Clerk, who after he hath written all the ſeveral ſentences, gives them to the Auditor, whether General, or Particular of a Regiment; and he obſerving wherein moſt agree, makes that the ſentence of the Court which is ſign'd by the Preſident, and ſo ſent to the General. if he have not preſided himſelf.

                     <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of Exerciſing, Drilling, and Training the ſeveral Bodies of the Cavalry, and the Infantry.</head>
                  <p>HAving levied and arm'd our Soldiers both of Horſe and Foot, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently entertain'd them with goodly promiſes of Pay, Proviant, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and free Quarter, and ſhown them under what Laws and Diſcipline they are to live, it will be time to teach them the Duties of Soldiers, and this is done by Exerciſing and Drilling them. What kinds of Exerciſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Soldiers were inur'd to in ancient times, hath been abundantly told you in my Diſcourſes of the <hi>Gracian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Art of War. Wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Running, Leaping, Swimming, all which harden and enable a mans Body, and render the Soldier active and dexterous in Battel, at Storms and Aſſaults, in purſuit of his enemy, and ſometimes in flight to ſave his own life, were the duties impoſed in ancient times, and to them properly belongs<note place="margin">Exerciſes properly ſo called.</note> the word of Exerciſe. But this kind of Exerciſe is now rather permitted than commanded. The uſing the Spade and Mattock in making Ramparts and Ditches, building Walls, Sconces, Forts, and Caſtles, conſtantly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in time of peace by the Ancients, eſpecially the <hi>Romans,</hi> is not now at all thought of, till either the Siege or defence of a Town, or the neceſſity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to fortifie a Camp render it neceſſary, and then ſix Soldiers (not accuſtom'd before to that manner of Exerciſe) are not able to work ſo much as one Country-fellow newly taken from the Plow. The cuſtom of ſhooting at Butts with Bow and Arrow in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> is much, if not wholly worn out. In foreign places their ſhooting with Firelocks and ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed Guns at Marks every Holy-day, may make them good Firemen, and good Markſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but doth not ſtrengthen the nerves and arms of men as the Bow did. But to bring theſe Exerciſes ſo much conducing to the health and ſtrength of an Army in faſhion again, muſt be the work of no private perſon, but of a Prince or State.</p>
                  <p>Another part of Military Exerciſe conſiſts in teaching the Soldiers both<note place="margin">Training and Drilling divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two parts,</note> of Horſe and Foot to fight orderly and readily with an Enemy, and this is that which properly we call Training and Drilling. It conſiſts of two parts, the firſt is, to teach them to handle and manage their offenſive Arms (whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be) handſomely, readily and dexterouſly, and this is ordinarily call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Poſtures. The ſecond is to make them when they are in a Body, to caſt themſelves in ſuch a figure or order as ſhall be commanded them, and this is commonly called the Motions and Evolutions.</p>
                  <p>Before I ſpeak any more on this Subject, I ſhall ſay that though this Drill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Training, be not ſo much forgot as thoſe other Exerciſes are, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have but juſt now ſpoken, yet it is too much neglected in many places,<note place="margin">Much negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</note> neither do I think it is ſo much uſed in any place of <hi>Europe,</hi> as in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Dominions, in which the Ancients are well imitated who train'd their Armies very punctually in time of Peace, as well as in time of War. I wiſh all Companies who otherwiſe are well enough train'd, were accuſtom'd to make Marches when they are exerciſed, as I ſaid in my Diſcourſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Arms. For though I do not deſire they ſhould be made to run or walk twenty, or five and twenty miles in five or ſix hours time, and in full Arms as the <hi>Romans</hi> did; yet I think they would be much ſtrengthen'd, and<note place="margin">Marching a neceſſary point of Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Exerciſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> made more healthful, and more able to endure fatigue, if they were made twice a week, march in a Summer-morning ſeven or eight miles and back again in the afternoon, and proportionably as far in the Winter. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequently practiſed in time of peace, would make long and ſpeedy
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:97406:116"/> Marches (which often are neceſſary in the time of War) even with Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Arms very eaſie, and it would accuſtom the Soldiers to keep their ranks and files punctually, provided Officers be attentive to ſee them do it on that March. This would be to ſome better purpoſe than for Commanders to march with Squads, with half or whole Regiments a half hour, it may be a whole one, up and down, to and again, upon one ſpot of ground; a right Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march<note place="margin">A Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march.</note> whereby ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Officers contrary to their intention (for they think they are doing a very handſome feat) make themſelves ridiculous to both the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and their own Soldiers. The <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> in time of War drill'd their Armies in the Fields, but Training is lookt upon now as an unneceſſary thing, not only in the Field, but in Towns and Garriſons likewiſe. This is not the Prince or States fault, but is an inexcuſable neglect and careleſneſs of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, who make not their Captains do their duty in ſo neceſſary a point of War. I have ſeen in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> Regiments newly raiſed, and ſome alſo ſent out of <hi>Sweden</hi> in the time of the long War before the Peace of <hi>Munſter,</hi> only exerciſed and drill'd three or four times, and that was enough for them<note place="margin">Supine care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of Colonels.</note> for the whole time they were to ſerve; for a man would have made himſelf ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous if he had ſpoken of drilling old Soldiers, to keep them in mind of their Poſtures and Motions; this would have been lookt on as a diſparagement to them, for it would have been preſuppoſed that they ſtood in need of Exerciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as in truth moſt of them did. It is a pity, and ſometimes matter of ſport, to hear men glory that they are old Soldiers, who either never have learned,<note place="margin">Old Soldiers.</note> or have forgot, what belongs to their profeſſion, and ſo upon the matter prove themſelves to be old fools. Nay, I have ſeen in theſe ſame Wars many new levied Companies, Troops and Regiments never Train'd or Exerciſed at all; nay, not ſo much as one leſſon given to a Soldier for the handling his Arms. It is true, moſt of thoſe who were levied in my time, had ſerv'd in thoſe Wars, which were before my time, but all had not, and therefore ſome were raw and unexperienced, and the oldeſt Soldiers of them needed exceedingly to have had their memories refreſht. This was the condition of five thouſand Foot, and three Troops of Horſe which the City of <hi>Dantzick</hi> levied and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd in the time of the late <hi>Swediſh</hi> War againſt <hi>Poland,</hi> from the year 1656, till the year 1660. I have not ſeen braver men, nor better equipp'd in any Militia than theſe were; but in one whole Summer that I was there, I never ſaw one Company, or one man of a Company drill'd or exercis'd. Since the Eſtates of the <hi>

But I ſuppoſe their late alarms have made them reſume their ancient care and diligence.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Military Exerciſes were ſo far worn out of uſe, that I knew Count <hi>Koningſmark</hi> in the year 1655, (when he raiſed ſome new Regiments for his Maſter the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>) take ſome old Officers to be Drill-maſters to the<note place="margin">Drill-maſters.</note> new levied Companies, which notwithſtanding were provided with all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers belonging to them, and theſe Drill-maſters he entertain'd with Monthly wages, which I thought was not done without ſome blemiſh to the reputation of all the Officers, eſpecially of the Colonels and Captains.</p>
                  <p>That part of Training which teacheth the handling Arms is different, to wit, that which teacheth a Horſeman to manage handſomely and readly his Piſtol, Carbine, and Sword, whether he be a Curiaſſier, or Harquebuſier, and that which teacheth a Foot ſoldier to handle his Muſquet and Pike, and his <hi>Swedes</hi> Feather, if he have one. And as a Horſeman is obliged to learn to Saddle and<note place="margin">Drilling of Horſemen.</note> Bridle his Horſe quickly and well, to mount and diſmount handſomely, to ride decently, and carry his body well, or as it is called to have a good ſeat in his Saddle, and how to uſe his voice, his hand, his leg, and his ſpur; ſo he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to teach his Horſe to obey him, whether it be in trotting, galloping, running, ſtanding, ſtopping, turning, or wheeling. The Horſeman ought to be taught how to keep his Piſtols and Carbine fixt, and bright without ruſt, how to charge them quickly, and prime them, how to fire them, and readily charge again. And he muſt be eſpecially careful not to ride a ſhie-horſe, for ſuch a one may not only bring his Rider in danger and diſgrace, but diſorder the whole Troop; Exerciſe, and accuſtoming his Horſe to all feats of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip,

Troops ſhould in ſome points be exerciſed by ſound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, that Horſemen may know the ſeveral points of War by their ſeveral names, as, to the Watch, to Saddle, to Horſe, to March, to Charge, to R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To teach either Horſemen or Foot-Soldiers their Motions and Evolutions<note place="margin">Motions, or Evolutions of Bodies both of Horſe and Foot.</note> when they are in Bodies greater or ſmaller, is the ſecond part of Training or Drilling. The words of command for both Horſe and Foot in theſe Motions are the very ſame, only the Diſtances are different. Three Foot are allowed between files of Foot, and that is order, ſix is open order, and twelve is open open order, or double double diſtance; and theſe you may make uſe of in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing, Marching, or Fighting, as you think convenient. In Marches the length of the Pike requires ſix foot of diſtance between ranks. Some allow in<note place="margin">Diſtances.</note> exerciſing Bodies of Horſe, ſix foot for ſingle diſtance between ranks and files, and twelve for double diſtance. The <hi>Germans</hi> ordinarily allow ten for the one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and twenty for the other. All theſe Motions and Evolutions may be reduced to four kinds, theſe are Facings, Doublings, Countermarchings, and Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. I do not intend to trouble either my Reader or my ſelf with the ſeveral words of command, ordinary Drill-maſters have moſt of them, though not all.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That none of the three ordinary ways uſed for doubling of ranks in<note place="margin">Firſt Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> Bodies of Foot, can be made uſe of in exerciſing Bodies of Horſe, as now they are Marſhalled in moſt places of <hi>Europe,</hi> that is three deep, or three in file; nor can it be where they are five in file, as in ſome places they were all odd numbers, being improper for doublings either of ranks or files.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Facing of a great Body of Horſe to either right or left<note place="margin">Second.</note> hand, or about by either right or left hand is a difficult work, (though with Bodies of Foot it is the eaſieſt motion of all the reſt) and cannot be ſuddenly done, and therefore is dangerous if an enemy be near to take advantage of the diſorder of the motion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If all the three Countermarches, <hi>Laconian, Macedonian,</hi> and <hi>Chor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>an,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Third.</note> be of very little uſe and great danger in the Infantry, (as I have endeavour'd to make appear in one of my Diſcourſes of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Militia) then I ſuppoſe it will be eaſily granted that the uſe of any of the three is as little, and the danger as great in Bodies of Cavalry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That I conceive Wheeling a more proper motion, and more eaſie<note place="margin">Fourth.</note> for the Horſe than for the Foot, it is a motion that hath been much uſed by Horſe in fight, for unleſs in wheeling they are charged in the flank (and if ſo they are ill ſeconded) they are quickly reduced to their firſt poſture, but it is not ſo with the Foot, for if the Body be but indifferently great, ſuppoſe fifteeen hundred men, ſtanding at three foot diſtance in files, and ſix in ranks, you muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irſt make them come both ranks and files to their cloſe order before you can wheel your Battel, and that requires ſome time, for it is a motion of it ſelf; and the greater the Body be, the longer time it will have to make that firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for great Bodies move ſlowly. Next, the motion it ſelf of wheeling the Battel, is not ſoon done if well done, for if it be not order'd diſcreetly, the Body is immediately in confuſion. Thirdly, when you have wheel'd this Body of fifteen hundred men, you muſt beg yet a Ceſſation of Arms from your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, till you put your Battel in a fighting poſture, which you cannot do till you
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:97406:117"/> reduce them to their firſt order; for at cloſe order your Muſque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eers cannot fight, and therefore you muſt cauſe your Battel to open<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is true, the ranks will quickly open backward, but the files being no leſs in a Body of fifteen hundred men than two hundred and fifty, muſt have ſuch a time to open, (though they do it with all the haſt imaginable) that a reſolute Body of Horſe will Charge thorough them before you end theſe three motions. But a Body of Horſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in rank and file at that diſtance at which it is to fight, needs no command to cloſe ranks and files before it wheel, nor no command to open them after it hath wheel'd, being conſtantly in a poſture to receive an enemy. And with ſubmiſſion to great Drill maſters, I ſhould think the motions of Facing and Countermarching of Bodies of Horſe, whether greater or ſmaller, might be ſpared in their Exerciſe, becauſe you may face an enemy with a Squadron of Horſe either in flank or reer, by wheeling either to the right or left hand, or by either of the two about, a great deal ſooner, with a great deal of more eaſe, and with a great deal of leſs danger than you can do by either Facing or Countermarching.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Obſerve that no man can or will attain to a perfect underſtanding of<note place="margin">Fifth.</note> either poſtures, motions or evolutions in the Training particular men, or yet Bodies of Horſe and Foot by reading the words of command in a Book or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or looking upon the figures of them, for the Military Art is practical, one ſhall underſtand what belongs to Drilling and Training, more by looking on the real practice of it three days, than by the contemplative ſtudy of it three years: when you ſee a Countermarch in the Field, you will quickly underſtand what an Evolution it is when you ſee the figure of it in a Book; but you will not ſo ſoon know what it ſignifies when you ſee the figure before the practice.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, I avouch it to be the eſſential duty of a Captain to Exerciſe his<note place="margin">Sixth.</note> Troop, or company himſelf, whether it be of Foot or Horſe, nor ſhould it be permitted that his Lieutenant ſhould do it when he is preſent, much leſs a Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant (as I have often ſeen) for thereby he Uncaptains himſelf, and changeth pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with his Lieutenant. And this is too ordinary a Military grievance, againſt which the Earl of <hi>Swafford</hi> guarded by an expreſs inſtruction that no Lieutenant ſhould exerciſe a Company, unleſs the Captain were abſent, which he might not be, without either ſickneſs, or that Lords own permiſſion; a very juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. And by the ſame reaſon all Colonels ſhould exerciſe their Regiments, and in their abſence their Lieutenant Colonels, but when either of them are preſent, the Major ought neither to be commanded, nor of himſelf offer to do it, and this is contrary to the opinion of many, who will impoſe ſo many du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on a Major, that they make thereby Colonels, and Lieutenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Colonels, Cyphers, or very inſignificant Creatures.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of Compaies, Regiments, and Brigades of Foot, what they have been, what they are, how they are Marſhal'd, of all their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, their Duties and Qualifications.</head>
                  <p>I Suppoſe moſt Military men acknowledg the Infantry to be the Body of an Army, with it the Artillery, Munitions, and Proviſions lodg, and ſo doth he who commands in chief. The members of this Body are Regiments, or Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades, and the ſinews and arteries of theſe are Companies. A Company is a Band of armed men Marſhal'd in rank and file; a rank and file differ in this, that the firſt conſiſts of men, whether on horſeback or foot, ſtanding in one<note place="margin">A Rank and a File.</note> front ſide for ſide; the ſecond of men ſtanding in one row or lane, one behind another, ſo they may eaſily be converted, a file into a rank, and a rank into a file. The number of theſe ranks and files muſt be determined by the number of men appointed to be in each Company, for which there is no general rule, every Prince and State ordering that as they pleaſe, neither do they reſtrict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſtantly to one number, but appoint their Companies to be ſtronger and weaker as the emergency of affairs, or the preſent <hi>Ratio Belli</hi> ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</p>
                  <p>In former times ever ſince Gunpowder was invented, it has been ſo likewiſe, for ſometimes Companies were more numerous than at other times, yet never were the weakeſt of them of ſo ſmall a number, as generally now they be.</p>
                  <p>The firſt time I remember to have read of a Company of one hundred in the Modern War, was in the Civil Wars of <hi>France</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, about one hundred years ſince; in them I find that the Proteſtant Foot-Companies<note place="margin">Company of one hundred ſtrong.</note> were but generally one hundred ſtrong; for which I can gueſs at no reaſon, unleſs it were that many Gentlemen who were forc'd to take Arms, and durſt not ſtay at home, might be inveſted with Charges and Imployments ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their qualities: yet methinks it had conduced more to the advancement and proſecution of the grand deſign that Troops and Companies of <hi>Gens d'Armes,</hi> or Curiaſſiers had been made up of thoſe numbers of Gentlemen, a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice very fitting for them, and ſuiting well with the <hi>French</hi> humour.</p>
                  <p>But in thoſe Legions of <hi>France</hi> inſtituted by <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, (whereof I have ſpoken in my Diſcourſe of Levies) which conſiſted of ſix thouſand men a<note place="margin">Of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred:</note> piece, every Legion had twenty Companies, and every Company three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men. And though theſe Legions fell a great decadency from their Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Inſtitution in <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninths Reign, yet the number of three hundred in a Company continued long after that; for I do not find in all <hi>Monluc</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries (which he continues till near the end of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third's Reign) mention made of any <hi>French</hi> Company of Foot under three hundred Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Companies were either four hundred, or three hundred, till our own time.

                  <p>Formerly ſcarce the fourth part of a Company was arm'd with Fire-guns, whether Harquebuſſes, or Muſquets. In every one of the ſeven Legions which were ordain'd by <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, to be a conſtant Infantry in <hi>France,</hi>

In proceſs of time when Soldiers became expert at the Muſquet, Companies how ſtrong or weak ſoever were divided into three parts, two thirds whereof were Pikemen, and one third Muſqueteers; thereafter the Muſquet crav'd the half of the Game, and got it, ſo that each Company was equally divided into Pikemen and Muſqueteers. But equality<note place="margin">How for the preſent.</note> for moſt part is ſhort liv'd, and ſo far'd it in this, for very ſoon the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers challeng'd the two thirds, and obtain'd them, leaving but one third for the Pikemen, which for moſt part yet they keep, though in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (as I have ſaid before) Pikes are ſent to look for their fortune elſewhere.</p>

                  <p>Let us then ſuppoſe that which is moſtly true, that every Foot-Company conſiſts now of one hundred men, before we can marſhal it, we muſt know how many men the Prince or State alloweth to be in one file, which makes that which we call the depth of the Battel; the <hi>Latin</hi> and high <hi>Dutch</hi> Languages call it the heighth; the files being known, the ranks are quickly found. I am<note place="margin">Depth of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Bodies of Foot.</note> not here to tell you of the Square-root, by which many have ſtudied to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal their Batallions, for I intend to ſpeak fully of that in a Diſcourſe a part. But I ſpeak in this place of the depth that every Prince appoints for his Foot.</p>
                  <p>Before the Reign of the Great <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> for any thing I could ever learn, Foot-Companies were marſhal'd ten deep almoſt univerſally, but he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal'd<note place="margin">Ten deep.</note> all his Infantry in ſix ranks. And after he had invaded <hi>Germany,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour with moſt of the <hi>European</hi> Kings and Princes kept their Foot ſtill at ten deep; but before the end of that War which he began, all of them follow'd his way, and made the file of their Foot to conſiſt of ſix men, except the Prince of<note place="margin">Six deep.</note> 
                     <hi>Orange,</hi> who ſtill kept ten in file: I ſhould except likewiſe the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who in his Inſtructions for the better Diſcipline of his Army, order'd every<note place="margin">Eight deep.</note> Captain of Foot to draw up his Company eight deep.</p>
                  <p>In a buſineſs of this nature, where there is difference, a man may tell his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion without affectation of ſingularity; and therefore I ſuppoſe it will be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, that the more hands a Captain can bring to fight, the more ſhrewdly<note place="margin">Reaſons for ſix deep.</note> he will put his enemy to it, provided ſtill his Batallions be of that ſtrength as to receive the ſhock of a reſolute Impreſſion, and in caſe of the worſt, that he have Reſerves to come to his reſcue. Of Reſerves I ſhall ſpeak hereafter. Now I am hopeful it will not be deny'd me but that more hands are brought to fight by eight men in a file, than by ten, and more by ſix men in a file, than by eight. Take a ſecond argument, The more able you are to ſave your ſelf from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurrounded or out-wing'd by an enemy, or the more able you make your ſelf to ſurround and out-wing that enemy of yours, the greater advantage you have over him. Both theſe are done by a large front, now it is undeniable that eight in file enlarge the front more than ten, and ſix more than eight, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently eight deep contributes more than ten, and ſix more than eight for gaining the victory.</p>
                  <p>That more hands are brought to fight is very ſoon inſtanced, firſt by a Body<note place="margin">The great advantages 1500 Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers ſix deep have of 1500 Muſqueteers ten deep.</note> of Muſqueteers, and next by a Body of Pikemen. Let us ſuppoſe a Body of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred Muſqueteers marſhal'd ten deep is to fight with a Body of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers of equal number, that is fifteen hundred, ſix deep, and that they are equally ſtout and experienced, and equally good Firemen. The fifteen hundred ten deep muſt give fire by ranks, as the fifteen hundred ſix deep muſt likewiſe do; now the fifteen hundred ten deep can make no more but a hundred and fifty in rank, for a hundred and fifty multiplied by ten, produceth fifteen hundred, but the fifteen hundred ſix deep make two hundred and fifty in rank, for two hundred and fifty multiplied by ſix, produceth fifteen hundred; ſo that the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred ſix deep at every Volley pours one hundred Leaden Bullets more in the Enemies boſom, than the fifteen hundred ten deep; and conſequently when ſix ranks of both parties have fired, the fifteen hundred ten deep have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſix hundred Ball more than the fifteen hundred ſix deep, which without all doubt hath made a great many men fall more of the one ſide than the other. Next one hundred and fifty files of the fifteen hundred ſix deep, take juſt as much ground up in front as the whole Body of the fifteen hundred ten deep, and therefore the other hundred files of the fifteen hundred ſix deep, may fall on the ſides of the fifteen hundred ten deep, if they be not flanked either with Pikes, or with Horſemen. It is the like caſe, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> between fifteen hundred eight deep, and fifteen hundred ſix deep; for fifteen hundred eight deep will make but a hundred and eighty eight in rank, for a hundred eighty eight multiplied by eight produceth fifteen hundred and four; now the fifteen hundred ſix deep make two hundred and fifty ranks, and ſo ſhoots at every Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley ſixty two Bullets more than the fifteen hundred eight deep.</p>
                  <p>Make the like trial of two Batallions of Pikes, each of them fifteen hundred<note place="margin">The ſame advantages Pikemen alſo have.</note> ſtrong, equally arm'd for the defenſive, and their Pikes of equal length, the hundred files wherewith the fifteen hundred ſix deep out-wings the fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ten deep, will likewiſe enter on their ſides, and very ſoon ruin them if they
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:97406:119"/> be not flanked by their friends; and though they be, yet theſe hundred files of the fifteen hundred Pikemen ſix deep, being otherwiſe idle may happily give their flanks ſome work to do. Nor hath the fifteen hundred Pikemen ten deep any advantage of the fifteen hundred ſix deep, in the force of the impreſſion; for I have demonſtrated in one of my Diſcourſes of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Militia, that ſix ranks of Pikemen may either give or receive the charge abundantly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where Pikemen are ten deep at their charge, the laſt four ranks ſhould keep their Pikes ported, becauſe the preſenting the points of them is altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Neither was it the apprehenſion of the weakneſs of his Body of Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers drawn up ſix deep, that made the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> make uſe of his Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to defend his Muſqueteers againſt the <hi>Polonian</hi> Horſe; for theſe Feathers may ſerve a Body of Firemen drawn up ten deep as well as a Body of Firemen drawn up ſix deep; neither indeed is it the deepneſs of a Body of Muſqueteers that can reſiſt a reſolute charge of Horſe, it muſt be Pikes, Halberts, or theſe Feathers, or ſomething like them.</p>
                  <p>Nor do I think after the Invention of Gunpowder, that ten deep was thought fit for Foot, in imitation of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as ſome fancy, for I have ſhewn in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other<note place="margin">Reaſons for ten deep.</note> place, that <hi>Vegetius</hi> (who is lookt on by many as the Oracle of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Militia) doth make the <hi>Roman</hi> file to conſiſt of eleven men, but I think it was out of this conſideration, that after the firſt rank had fired their Guns, they could not be ready to fire again till the other nine ranks had all fired, and withal a Muſquet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reſt was taken to help; with ſo much warineſs did our Anceſtors walk when firſt they made uſe of the new found Engines of fire.

And I ſuppoſe it needs be thought no Paradox in me to ſay that five ranks of Muſqueteers can fire one after another without intermiſſion, and<note place="margin">Five deep.</note> the firſt of the five be ready to fire again, before the laſt have diſcharged; let any Commander try it with expert Firemen, he will find it will be done eaſily enough. And that you may ſee that this is no new conceit of mine, I ſhall tell you that <hi>Giovio</hi> informs us that at <hi>Vienna</hi> the twenty thouſand Harquebuſiers that were in the Chriſtian Army, were all marſhal'd five deep, and ſo made four thouſand files. It is without all peradventure that the beſt Commanders then in <hi>Europe</hi> were there, who would not have permitted this if they had not known that the firſt rank could have fired and made ready again, before all the other four had diſcharged; neither muſt you impute this to the ignorance of the Hiſtorian (as being a Churchman) for he is ſo punctual as to write nothing of any Military action but what he had from the relation of the greateſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that were upon the place.</p>
                  <p>And truly if you will conſider all I have ſaid, or all that may be ſaid on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſons for it.</note> you may perhaps think with me that both Muſqueteers and Pikemen may be marſhal'd five deep with no inconvenience at all to the ſervice. I think I hear ſome ſpeculative perſons cry out, that this is againſt the rules of all Tacticks, who reject odd numbers as unfit for doubling. But ſtay, do you exerciſe for ſhew only, or for uſe. If only for ſhew, I grant you ſhould neither have odd ranks<note place="margin" type="runSum">Objections againſt it.</note> nor files; but if for uſe, I ſay, that five deep is better than ſix deep, for thoſe very reaſons that made ſix deep better than eight deep, and eight better than ten. You ſay you cannot double your ranks at five deep, what then? I ſay you need not, for I would have your ranks no fewer than five when you are ten<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> deep; why double you your ranks, is it not to make them five? and thereby to enlarge your front, and why then may you not be five ranks at firſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſave your ſelf the labour of doubling? And as it is not at all neceſſary to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ranks, when your Batallion conſiſts of no more but five ranks, ſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the doubling of ranks not neceſſary when your Battel is but ſix deep, for
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:97406:119"/> three ranks of Pikes is not ſtrong enough either to give or receive a Charge, nor are they numerous enough for Muſqueteers to fire one rank after another without interruption, it not being feaſible for the firſt rank to fire, and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy before the third rank have diſcharged, ſo that when ſix ranks are made three, it is only for a parting blow, for the Muſqueteers to fire kneeling, ſtooping, and ſtanding. Now you may order the firſt three ranks of five to fire in the ſame faſhion, kneeling, ſtooping, and ſtanding, and you have by the bargain two ranks in reſerve, till the firſt three recover, and thoſe two ranks may afterward fire, the firſt rank kneeling, and the ſecond ſtanding; and then all the five ranks have fired, and are as ready either with Buts of Muſquets or Swords to receive the enemy if he advance, as the ſix ranks doubled in three, and in far better order. Either then your doubling of ranks is unneceſſary in ſervice, or five deep at firſt is as good (if not better) as ten ranks to be doubled in five, or ſix ranks doubled in three. And though five ranks cannot be doubled, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of that is not ſo great as the advantages it hath of a large front, and bringing many hands to fight; and if upon any emergency (which will fall out very ſeldom) you conceive your front too large, you may quickly help it,<note place="margin" type="runSum">The Authors private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> by cauſing your files to double, and then you are ten deep. But I ſhall quickly part with this opinion, when I hear a ſtronger argument againſt it than that, which ſays, that thereby ranks cannot be doubled; for the truth is, it is my private opinion that there be many ſuperfluous words in Exerciſe, and though I think doubling of ranks and files too, ſometimes convenient before the near approach of an enemy, yet I hope none will deny that both of them are very improper in the time of ſervice. But, <hi>Loquendum cum vulgo,</hi> is a Golden ſentence.</p>
                  <p>Well, we have our Foot-Company no ſtronger than one hundred men, and<note place="margin">Seventeen Files in a Company of one hundred men.</note> divided into three parts, whereof two are Muſqueteers, and Pikemen are glad to be admitted to make the third. Theſe muſt be marſhal'd ſix in one file, now ſeventeen times ſix is more than one hundred, and ſixteen times ſix is leſs than one hundred. Add therefore three Corporals to the hundred Soldiers, you ſhall have ſeventeen compleat files, and one man over, whom you may appoint to help the Enſign to carry his Colours, for a Furer is not allow'd him in all eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments. A Company being thus marſhal'd in ſeventeen files, eleven muſt be Muſqueteers, and ſix Pikemen, to wit, on the right hand of the Pikemen, ſix files of Muſqueteers, and on the left hand five files.</p>
                  <p>The Captain is to teach his Soldiers to keep their juſt diſtances between file<note place="margin">The ſeveral kinds of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</note> and file, end between rank and rank. Diſtances are ordinarily threefold, Order, open Order, and cloſe Order. The firſt of three foot, the ſecond of ſix, the third of one foot and a half, to which in ſome caſe is added open open order, which is of twelve foot. At Exerciſings both ranks and files ſhould ſtand at open order, in Marches the files at order, but the ranks at open order, becauſe of the Pikes which muſt have more ground than Muſqueteers require, and in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice both the files and ranks of Muſqueteers muſt be at order, that is three foot diſtance, but the Pikemen both in file and rank at cloſe order, that is at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of one foot and a half. I muſt tell you in this place of a general miſtake,<note place="margin">Miſtakes in reckoning Diſtances.</note> and is the very ſame I accuſed <hi>Vegetius</hi> of in the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia, and it is this: All ſay that the files when they ſtand in Battel, ſhould be at order, that is at the diſtance of three foot, as indeed they ſhould. But if you ask how many foot of ground ſeventeen files (whereof our Company conſiſts) poſſeſs in front, they will immediately anſwer you, fifty and one. And here there is a double<note place="margin">Diſtance of Files.</note> error, firſt, no ground is allowed for the Combatants to ſtand on, for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of three foot between files, takes up that one and fifty foot, or very near it. Secondly, they make ſeventeen files to have ſeventeen diſtances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they have but ſixteen. This overſight I have obſerv'd in moſt Tacticks, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Colonel <hi>Elton</hi> is very clear in his definition of a diſtance, which (though I told you of it before) I ſhall again give you. Diſtance, ſays he, is a place or interval of ground between every rank and rank, and every file and file, as they ſtand. By this deſcription then, three foot of diſtance being allowed between every file and file, there are in ſeventeen files ſixteen diſtances or intervals, which make but forty and eight foot, then you are to allow ſeventeen foot to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants, that is one foot for every man to ſtand on, ſeventeen being added to forty eight, make ſixty five, and ſo many foot of ground doth a Company poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:97406:120"/> in front, if it conſiſt of ſeventeen files; for the ground of the ranks you are to compute it thus: Six ranks take ſix foot to ſtand on, and thirty foot for five in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals (ſix foot being allow'd for open order) in all ſix and thirty foot, which a<note place="margin">Diſtance of Ranks.</note> Company, Regiment, Brigade, or Army of Foot, conſtantly poſſeſſeth from the toes of the Leaders to the heels of the Bringers up, unleſs you bring the ranks to ſtand at order, which you may frequently do with very good reaſon, and then the five Intervals take up but fifteen foot, which being added to the ſix foot on which the ranks ſtand, make but twenty one foot. And when Pikes are to give or receive a Charge, you may bring them to cloſe order, that is one foot and a half, and then the five Intervals take up but 7½ foot, theſe being added to ſix, make 13½ foot. Obſerve that in Exerciſing this Company of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen Files, you are to ſet aſide one of the Files, becauſe it is odd, and ſo<note place="margin">The Colours.</note> will hinder the doubling the Files. The Colours of the Company are to be on the head of the Pikes, neither can they conveniently be between the ſecond and third rank in time of Battel, as ſome would have them to be, for you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conſider what room an Enſign can have with his Colours between ranks when they are at order, much leſs at cloſe order, as they ſhould be in the time of Battel.</p>
                  <p>It will be fitting before I go further, to meet with an objection concerning<note place="margin" type="runSum">Objection againſt my Diſtances of Files,</note> Diſtances, it is this: The three foot of diſtance allowed between Files, ſay they, muſt be reckoned from the Centers, that is from the two middle parts of the two File-leaders, as from the middle part of the right hand File-leader to the middle part of the File-leader, who ſtands on his left hand. I wonder at this notion, for hereby two File-leaders take up one foot of ground, and ſo doth the reſt of the File, and there are but two foot of Interval between the two files, and this cannot at all quadrate with the definition of diſtance, for that is an Interval between Files, and not betwixt the two middle parts of two mens Bodies. And the Authors of Tacticks ſhould have been clearer in their expreſſions, and have ſaid, two foot between Files which they knew was too<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> little, and have added that every File ſhould have one foot of ground to ſtand on, for what language is this, a man ſhall have half a foot for his right middle part, and another half foot for his left middle part; for this way of their rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of the three foot of diſtance, amounts to juſt ſo much, and no better language, which I conceive is very improper? beſides, by this account the right and left hand Files, would have each of them one half foot of ground more than any of the reſt of the Files, the right hand Filemen hath it by the right middle parts of their bodies, and the left hand Filemen by the left middle parts of their Bodies, becauſe theſe two Files on theſe two hands have no Sidemen, which you may eaſily conceive if you pleaſe a little to conſider it.</p>
                  <p>Let us in the next place ſee what Officers are appointed to have the command<note place="margin">Of Officers of a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> and inſpection of this Company, and here we may find ſome difference in the ſeveral eſtabliſhments of Princes and States, yet in this we find all agree to have a Captain, a Lieutenant, an Enſign, Serjeants, Corporals and Drummers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Spaniard</hi> who rejects the Lieutenant as uſeleſs; ſome allow no more Officers than thoſe I have ſpoken of, ſome allow more, to wit, a Captain of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, a Furer, a Fourier, and a Clerk or Scrivener. And beſides, ſome allow Lancepeſats, or Lancpreſads (as they are commonly called) as alſo Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's, and Gentlemen of a Company. But neither Lancepeſats, Gentlemen of the Company, nor Reformado's are Officers, and though Corporals be, yet they carry Arms and march in rank and file. I ſhall deſcribe all theſe, and all the Officers of a Foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Company, beginning with the Reformado, and ending with the Captain.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe are called Reformado's, or Reformed, who have been Officers (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe<note place="margin">Reformed Officers.</note> Commiſſionated, and thoſe only) and are out of charge, and bear Arms, till they can be prefer'd. In ſome places they are permitted to be without Arms.</p>
                  <p>A Gentleman of the Company is he who is ſomething more than an ordinary<note place="margin">Gentleman of a Company.</note> Souldier, hath a little more pay, and doth not ſtand Centinel.

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:97406:120"/> or ſpent Lance. He is a Gentleman of no ancient ſtanding in the Militia, for he draws his Pedigree from the time of the Wars between <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, and his Son <hi>Henry</hi> the Second Kings of <hi>France,</hi> on the one part, and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and his Brother-in-law the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> on the other part, in thoſe Wars when a Gentleman of a Troop of Horſe in any Skirmiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Battel, or Rencounter, had broke his Lance on his enemy, and loſt his Horſe in the Scuffle, he was entertain'd (under the name of a Broken-Lance) by a Captain of a Foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Company as his Comerade, till he was again mounted. But as all good orders fall ſoon from their Primitive Inſtitution, ſo in a ſhort time our <hi>Monſieur Lanceſpeſata</hi> (for ſo he was called) was forc'd to deſcend from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Lanceſpeſata.</note> the Captains Comerade, and became the Corporals Companion, and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the Exerciſe of his Charge, and therefore was ſometimes called by the <hi>French, Aide Caporal.</hi> But when the <hi>Caporal</hi> grew weary of the Comradeſhip of his <hi>Lanceſpeſata,</hi> he made him officiate under him, and for that had ſome allowance of pay more than the common Soldier, which he enjoys in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where he is made uſe of, and ſtill keeps the noble Title of <hi>Lanceſpeſata,</hi> (though perhaps he was never on Horſeback in his life) corruptly <hi>Lancepreſado<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Upon the watch the Corporal (having got orders from his Superiors) appoints, when, where, and how long each of his men are to ſtand Centinel, and he is bound to teach them how they<note place="margin">His Duties.</note> are to behave themſelves when they are Centinels, and is to viſit them frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but if he find any one of them aſleep, he muſt not leave him as he found him, as an <hi>Athenian</hi> Captain did, (who kill'd a ſleeping Centinel) but he muſt bring him to the <hi>Corps de Guard,</hi> and there make him Priſoner till further order. The <hi>Caporal</hi> is to receive the Rounds at his Court of Guard, and take the word from them. But of this I ſhall tell you more in another place.

In the high <hi>Dutch</hi> he was called <hi>Feltwebell,</hi> but now the word Serjeant hath prevailed over all. When Companies were three hundred ſtrong, there were three Serjeants in it, now for moſt part all Companies have two. It is a charge of very much fatigue, for to him it belongs<note place="margin">His Fatigue and Duties.</note> to ſee all his Captains commands obeyed, he gives all the Under-Officers (except the Clerk) their directions, what they are to do almoſt in every particular, and the like he doth to the <hi>Caporals.</hi> He receives the watch-word and all other Orders from the Major of the Regiment, carries them to his Captain, receives his, and delivers both to his Lieutenant, and Enſign, to his fellow Serjeant, to the <hi>Caporals,</hi> and when it is his turn, watcheth with his Halbert, either on a Poſt alone, or under a Commiſſionated Officer. Yet for all this his place in many parts of the world, is not thought creditable, (but ſure it is not diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.) I cannot conceive for what reaſon, unleſs it be that his title of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant makes him be thought one of that Canaille who drag people to priſon, and theſe indeed are of the very dregs of the Raſcality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Louis de Montgomery</hi> ſays that in his time (and that was about ſixty years ago)<note place="margin">His Charge too much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued.</note> no man of an honeſt family in <hi>France</hi> would accept of a Serjeants place, which could have been for no other reaſon but that I have mention'd, the very name of a Serjeant deterring men from the charge; and it is ſo ſtill in moſt places, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> and here at home. And I have wonder'd very oft to hear mean Gentlemen ſay, they ſcorn a Halbert, but if you will give them a Pike, they will gladly accept of it, for which they have not above the third of a Serjeants pay; and when they are Pikemen, they muſt punctually obey the Serjeants commands, or bear the weight of that Halbert over their Heads, which they ſcorn'd to carry on their ſhoulders; for a Serjeant hath power to beat both with his Halbert and his Sword. And ſure if his Charge be not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, it is honeſt, and ſhould not be ſo much vilipended, which ſuperior Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers might ſoon help if they would cheriſh Serjeants more than many of them do. I encounter'd once with a Country man of my own at the <hi>Buſch,</hi> who told me he had ſerv'd the Eſtates full forty years; I askt him if in all that time he had
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:97406:121"/> ever got the preferment to be a Serjeant, he reply'd, he might have had a Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert often, but ſcorn'd it: I enquir'd then if he had attain'd to any degree bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a Serjeants place? he told me, yes; for at that very time he ſaid, he was the oldeſt Gentleman of a Company in the Eſtates ſervice. To which dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity I could not chuſe but wiſh him much joy.</p>
                  <p>The Enſign is more properly called the Enſign bearer, than any other title<note place="margin">Enſign-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</note> we give him in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for Ancient ſeems to be an improper and corrupt word.

His title ſhews his Office, his principal charge (where Lieutenants are allowed) is to have a care of the Colours in time of action, whether it be Battel or Aſſault, he ought<note place="margin">In <hi>France,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Guards, there be now only two Enſigns, one of the Colonel, the other of the Lieutenant-Colonel.</note> to be valiant, and rather die than loſe the Enſign recommended to his care. After he hath march'd a mile out of his Quarters, he may ride and give the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours to another to carry, which other is ordinarily a Pikeman, (whoſe Pike his Companions are obliged to carry by turns) but at the ſight of a General Officer or his own Colonel, the Enſign-bearer is bound to alight and take his Colours in his own hand. In <hi>France</hi> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, he was allow'd to have a young fellow to aſſiſt him to carry his Colours, who for that ſervice had half a Soldiers Pay. But I have ſhewn you that in other places a Furer is allow'd for that, who in Quarters or Camps doth the duty of an under Officer with a Halbert.</p>
                  <p>If you will have the deſcription of a Lieutenant, as ordinarily it is given, he<note place="margin">A Lieutenant.</note> ſhould be valourous, well experienc'd in matters of War, and who hath given proof of it, vigilant, and patient of fatigue ſhould know the wants of the<note place="margin">His Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> Company, and ſhould endeavour to get them ſupply'd, ſhould know to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the Company in its poſtures, motions and evolutions, and ſhould be of ſuch a behaviour as to gain both love and reſpect from the Soldiers. But I ask, if he be all this, what hinders him to be Captain, or if he muſt ſtill keep the title of Lieutenant, what needs any Captain at all? It is anſwer'd, the Captain ſhould have all theſe qualifications, but when he is abſent, the Lieutenant repreſents him: true, but when the Captain is preſent, whom repreſents the Lieutenant then? I ſuppoſe no body, for his title ſhews him to be a Deputy, who is no more a Deputy when the perſon (whoſe Deputy he was) is preſent. Next it is<note place="margin">Whether needful, or not.</note> ſaid the Lieutenant is in the reer, when the Captain is in the Van, and in the Van when the Captain is in the Reer; true, but ſo may the Enſign bearer be, having his Colours carried by another, whoſe wages ſhall not be the fourth part of thoſe of a Lieutenant. And ſince in all Charges of an Army the inferior ſtill Officiates in the abſence of the ſuperior, why ſhould a Colonel have a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Colonel, and a Captain a Lieutenant, whoſe duty is only to officiate when the Colonel and Captain are abſent? for when they are preſent to ſpeak ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Lieutenant-Colonel, and Lieutenant, have not one word to ſay, no commands to give, nor puniſhment to inflict; and therefore when the Colonel is abſent, the Major may as well do his duty as the oldeſt Captain doth the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors. I ſuppoſe for theſe reaſons the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (a warlike people) have ſtruck Lieutenants and Lieutenant-Colonels quite out of their Rolls in all their <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Regiments. I have heard that <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> intended to have done as much but that the <hi>Swedes</hi> would not part with their ancient cuſtom, nor would give way to bring <hi>Spaniſh Abfero's</hi> in their Armies; and therefore the King (who it ſeems thought not the Lieutenant very neceſſary) order'd the Enſign-bearer to have equal pay with the Lieutenant, and to do equal duty with him in Watches and Guards. It is hard to perſwade ſome people to part with an ancient cuſtom; and they ſay all Innovations though for the better, are dangerous; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Innovations dangerous.</note> Lieutenants need not be angry with me for my private opinion, that they are none of the moſt neceſſary Officers in an Army, will do them but little hurt.</p>
                  <p>But the truth is, that which moſtly makes Lieutenants neceſſary is, that at firſt Levies, Captains are choſen who are unexperienc'd, yet becauſe of their<note place="margin">A Captain,</note> birth and quality are thought fit to have the command of Companies to be raiſed in thoſe places where the authority of themſelves and their friends conduceth much to the furtherance of the Levy, whether it be made by the authority of the Prince, or by a voluntary Enrolling.

                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:97406:122"/> requires a Captain to be a Gentleman of good birth, young, valiant, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral, and doth not at all require experience. But if you like not that, but will have another deſcription of a Captain, then I pray take that which I have given of a Lieutenant, and I ſuppoſe you will believe, it may ſerve them both. Having given you the deſcription of ſo many Officers of a Company of one hundred men, I think you will conclude that Company will in a very ſhort time conſiſt of able and well exercis'd Soldiers, I wiſh it may be ſo, and I am ſure it ſhould be ſo.</p>
                  <p>In former times a Captain march'd in the head of his Company with a Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, a Corſlet, and a Gorge, all high Proof, and ſo did the Lieutenant in<note place="margin">Captain and Lieutenant in Harneſs,</note> the Reer.

The difference of the Armour was none but that the Captains Helmet was decored with a Plume of Feathers, the Lieutenants not. The Feathers you may peradventure yet find, but the Headpiece for moſt part is laid aſide.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Captains and Lieutenants likewiſe carry Pikes, the<note place="margin">With Pikes.</note>

The Marqueſs of <hi>Guaſt, Alphonſo Davalo,</hi> who had the command of ſeveral Imperial Armies, when his Maſter <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth took a view of his numerous forces at <hi>Vienna,</hi> march'd in the head of the Infantry with a Pike in his hand. Marſhal <hi>Monluc</hi> at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of <hi>Cereſole</hi> carried a Pike, becauſe he led a great Batallion of Pikes; but on all other occaſions he uſed a Halbert or Partiſan, as he tells us in ſeveral places<note place="margin">An Halbert, or Partiſan.</note> of his Commentaries, in one whereof ſpeaking of the Halbert, he ſays, <hi>Il a touſiours aymé, de me jouer de ce baſton lá:</hi> I lov'd always, ſays he, to play with that batton. And aſſuredly a Partiſan or Halbert is a more manageable weapon for an Officer, than a Pike. The Serjeant is diſtinguiſhed from the Captain and Lieutenant becauſe he ſhoulders his Halbert, they comport theirs. And I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it were fit the Captain and Lieutenants, Halberts or Partiſans ſhould be diverſified by ſeveral trimmings, that the one may be diſtinguiſht from the other. The word Captain is a general word for all Commanders, as Captains of fifties,<note place="margin">Captain a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Title.</note> of hundreds, and of thouſands; and he who commands over all the forces, is called very properly a Captain General, but now it is moſt ordinarily taken for him who commands a private Company or Troop, and ſo paſſeth current in all Languages that I underſtand.</p>
                  <p>A Company being thus deſcrib'd with all its Officers, a Regiment is ſoon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,<note place="margin">A Regiment,</note> which I ſhall define to be a certain number of Companies join'd in one body under one head.

                  <p>A Regiment thus compoſed of ten Companies hath Officers (beſides thoſe of Companies already deſcrib'd) whoſe charges belong equally to all the ten, thoſe are called Officers of the Staff, in high <hi>Dutch</hi> the Etymology of the word I<note place="margin">A Regiment-Staff.</note> cannot give you; theſe are the Colonel, the Lieutenant-Colonel, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, theſe three are called likewiſe Officers of the Field.

The Auditor hath that ſame power in a Regiment that<note place="margin">Auditor.</note> a General Auditor or Judg-Marſhal hath in an Army, and what that is I have told you in the ninth Chapter of our Modern Art of War. In ſome places to ſave expence, they make the Quarter-maſter ſupply this Scriveners place, nor do ſome Princes allow any Regiment-Auditor, though I think him a very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Officer, for without him our Regiment-Courts of War (eſpecially if the buſineſs be of any intricacy) are very diſorderly; nor do ſome allow wages to Regiment-hangmen, and where they are wanting, capital crimes muſt be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht<note place="margin">Hangman.</note> by Harquebuſiers, and ſcourging muſt be converted into the Gatloupe.

And if the Victuallers, Sutlers and Mark-tenters tranſgreſs, he is to make price of thoſe Wares, in venting whereof any of them did fail, the half whereof belongs to the Judg-Marſhal, and the other moiety to the Princes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator Fiſcal, and he hath an allowance of every Hogſhead of Wine, Ale, Beer, and Brandy.</p>
                  <p>The Chirurgeon muſt be skilful in curing all manner of wounds (ſo they be<note place="margin">Chirurgeon.</note> not mortal) for many brave Gentlemen get their bones broken with Bullets, which would not ſo frequently prove deadly to the Patients if they were atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on by good and experienced Artiſts.

But if the Army be to encamp, he is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Quarter-maſter General ſuch a proportion of ground as the ſtrength of his Colonels-Regiment requires, which plot of ground he is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to mark at the four corners of it with four long ſtaves, upon which ſhould be ſome cognizance whereby to know for which Regiment that Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is deſign'd, and then the Quarter-maſter is to divide that piece of ground, taking firſt ſo much as ordinarily is allow'd for the Colonel and all his Regiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff, and then meaſuring to each Fourier as much ground as is allow'd for a Company with all its Officers; he is to ſee the Fouriers mark the ground aſſign'd to the particular Companies, with four leſſer ſtaves at the four corners of the deſign'd Quarter, and then ſubdivide that ground into ſo many parts for Huts, and to mark every Hut at its four corners with four little ſticks or twigs, and for all this he and his Fouriers ſhould have meaſures ſuch as are appointed by the Quarter-maſter General, and approv'd by the General, all which ſhall be ſpoke to more fully in my Diſcourſe of <hi>Caſtrametation.</hi> But the Regiment Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter muſt ſee all theſe things done himſelf, and not truſt the particulars to his Fouriers, who oft-times are very careleſs or ignorant, or both; and indeed our<note place="margin">His Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> Modern Armies produce but too many Quarter-maſters of little better ſtuff, though you ſee they ſhould be men of metal, who have learned ſome Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick, and have ſome skill of <hi>Caſtrametation.</hi> Formerly the Eldeſt Captains and Ritmaſters in <hi>Swediſh</hi> Regiments uſed to be their Quarter-maſters, but that cuſtom is worn out; at home our eſtabliſhment joins the Quarter-maſter, and Proforce, their charges in one perſon, which conjunction agrees not with all humours.</p>

                  <p>There is another inconſiderable Staff-Officer in moſt Armies, yet neceſſary enough in all Regiments of Foot, and that is the Drummer-Major, the <hi>French</hi> call him Colonel-Drummer: He is to receive his directions from the Major of<note place="margin">Drummer-Major.</note> the Regiment at what hour he is to beat to the watch, when the Dian, and when the Taptoo wherewith he is to acquaint the ſeveral Drummers of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, and appoint them by turns for theſe Beatings; he is alſo to order them in what diviſions each of them ſhall beat when the Regiment marcheth; and they are to obey all his directions punctually. In ſome places he gets a third more of pay than other Drummers, but here at home we acknowledg no ſuch Creature.</p>
                  <p>The Major of a Regiment is both an Officer of the Field, and of the Staff:<note place="margin">Major.</note> It is fit he be an underſtanding perſon, and experimented, of a quick appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion to receive his Orders, and a ready diſpatch in delivering them; he ſhould be vigilant, and of a body able to endure toil. He it is that marſhals the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and appoints every company its due place according to the Precedency they have one of another. He orders the Captains, Lieutenants, and Enſigns to lead Diviſions in a march according to their Dignity. In the Field he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the word and all other orders from the Major-General, and when he comes back to the Regiment, he is to give no orders out till firſt he hath impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to his Colonel and Lieutenant-Colonel, and received their directions; likewiſe he is to call one Serjeant of every Company together (at the ſetting of the watch is the proper time) and deliver the watch-word, and all his other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders punctually to them, that they may carry them to their ſeveral Officers. He is not only bound to give the Orders, but to ſee them obeyed, for he is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to viſit the Guards, and where he finds his directions either diſobey'd or neglected, he is to bring thoſe to an account who are acceſſary to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight or contempt.</p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:97406:123"/>
                  <p>The Inſpection the Major hath of the Guards, hath got him the title in <hi>Latin</hi> of<note place="margin">His Duties.</note> 
                     <hi>Vigiliarum Praefectus:</hi> If he be in Quarters where the Regiment lyes alone, far from the General, he receives his Orders from his Colonel; in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from his Lieutenant-Colonel; in a Garriſon from the Governour. The <hi>French</hi> Diſcipline admits him not to command Captains, unleſs he have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany himſelf. The <hi>Swedes</hi> of a long time allowed him no company, yet allow'd him the command over Captains, but it is now many years ago ſince they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to have companies; hence perhaps it is that when they have no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, they may be called Serjeant-Majors, as when they have companies, the <hi>Germans</hi> call them Captain-Majors, but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> uſe frequently the words of Serjeant Major, and Serjeant-Major General, none of them are uſed either by <hi>German, Swede,</hi> or <hi>Dane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Lieutenant-Colonel is that in a Regiment that a Lieutenant is in a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,<note place="margin">Lieutenant-Colonel.</note> and therefore when the Colonel is preſent, the Lieutenant-Colonel hath no command; and ſince in the Colonels abſence the other commands the Regiment, I think he ſhould be endued with all thoſe qualifications that are required to be in a Colonel, and what theſe are I ſhall tell you as others have told me, with my own ſenſe of them.</p>
                  <p>A Colonel ſay ſome ſhould be a Gentleman of great experience in Military<note place="margin">Colonel.</note> Affairs, bold and reſolute, courteous, affable, liberal, judicious, and religious: But ſuch deſcriptions of Military Officers ſeem to proceed from thoſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers who teach men to conform their lives and actions to the ſtrict and ſevere rules of Moral vertue; for my part I would not only have a Colonel to be pious and religious, but his whole Regiment likewiſe; but becauſe this may rather be wiſht than expected, I ſay, if he be not exemplarily pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, he may notwithſtanding be a Colonel good enough, ſo he be not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Atheiſt. I would have a Colonel to be affable and liberal, but though<note place="margin">His Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> he be both churliſh and Parſimonious, he may be a Colonel good enough. I would have a Colonel to be experienced in moſt of the points of War; yet though he be not, and hath ſeen but little, if he be of a ready wit and good judgment, he may be a Colonel good enough: for Princes and States, when they raiſe Armies, think it fit to make choice of Colonels who can levy Regiments, for which employment without queſtion men of good birth and quality are moſt proper. But courage, an aptitude to learn, and proneneſs to follow advice, are qualities very eſſential and requiſite in all men of that charge, it is little matter how avaritious a Colonel be, ſo he offer not to meddle with any part of the pay of his Regiment, except his own. It is the leſs matter though he be ignorant in ſome points belonging to his command, ſo he be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be adviſed by thoſe of his Officers who underſtand them: But thoſe who fancy that the Title of Colonels entails a right upon them, to command what they pleaſe, and to pay their Regiments as they like, and by their wilful igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance confound matters of Government, and Diſcipline, and introduce and frame Cuſtoms in their Regiments, which no others uſe, ſhould be chac'd out of all Armies as preſumptuous, arrogant, and impertinent, if not worſe.</p>
                  <p>Having ſpoken now ſufficiently of all the Officers belonging to a Company and Regiment of Foot, it will be time to put the ſeveral Companies in one Body, thereby to make a Regiment; but I will firſt tell the Captains that after they have for ſome time exercis'd their Companies, and thereby known the abilities of their ſeveral Soldiers, they muſt be careful to put them in ranks and files according as they find they deſerve; the propereſt, talleſt and ſtrongeſt men they ſhould arm with Pikes, the reſt with Muſquets. Next to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals the moſt deſerving ſhould be File-leaders; the next place of dignity is the<note place="margin">To marſhal a Company in ranks and files.</note> reer, the third is the middle or fourth rank, the fourth dignity is the ſecond rank, as being next the Van, the fifth place of dignity is the fifth rank, as that which is next the reer; the ſixth and laſt place is the third rank: All this is meant where all Companies and Batallions of Foot are marſhal'd ſix deep. Next to this the Captain ſhould have regard to the right and left hand files, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving drawn up his men as he thinks each of them deſerves, he is to command his Clerk to write down the names of all that are in Arms, juſt as they ſtand in files, and thereafter when he draws out his Company, let him conſtantly put them in Battel according to that Roll; this being done four or five days, the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:97406:124"/> Soldiers by cuſtom knowing their places, their Leaders, and their Sidemen, will be able without the help of their Officers to marſhal themſelves. When all the Companies are to be join'd in one Body, every Captain ſhould caſt his odd men in the reer, (and it is impoſſible there can be above five odd men in one Company) that the Major may make files, and ſo join them to the Regiment in ſuch places as he thinks fitting.</p>
                  <p>There be ſeveral ways of drawing up Regiments of Foot, and they may vary according to the ſeveral opinions of men, and yet all of them may be good enough: But a Major ſhould not marſhal the Regiment according to his own fancy, or yet that of his Colonels, but according to the known practice of the Prince or State, in whoſe Service he is; for Uniformity is required in Military<note place="margin">Uniformity in Marſhalling Regiments in one Prince his Service.</note> Cuſtoms as much, or rather more than in other things. The pleaſure of the Prince, or of his General in matters which depend on their own judgments, ought not to be debated or diſputed. I will not trouble my Reader with the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of opinions in marſhalling the ſeveral Companies, according to the Precedency of thoſe to whom they belong, whether theſe be Officers of the Field, or private Captains, when they are to be join'd in one Body: But ſhall lay down three grounds, wherein I ſuppoſe all our Modern Commanders agree. Theſe are,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Regiment ſhould be marſhal'd in a Square front, the Wedg, Rhombus, and Ring-Battels, not being now made uſe of, except for ſhow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Pikemen make the Body, and the Muſqueteers the wings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Colonels Company ought to have conſtantly the right hand, whether the Regiment be drawn up in one, two, or three diviſions. When Regiments were two or three thouſand ſtrong, it was thought fit to marſhal them in three Batallions or Diviſions, and theſe were called, the Colonels, the Lieutenant-Colonels, and the Majors Diviſions; but being to ſpeak of a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſting only of one thouſand, and compoſed of ten Companies, I ſhall tell you how I have ſeen ſuch a one marſhal'd both in one and in two Diviſions, the manner whereof pleaſeth me better than any other that I have either ſeen or read of, leaving notwithſtanding every man free to his own choice, for I offer not to impoſe.</p>
                  <p>The Major of the Regiment having either chuſed the ground himſelf, or got it aſſign'd to him by the Major-General, if he be to draw up in one Diviſion,<note place="margin">A Regiment marſhal'd in one Diviſion.</note> orders the Colonels Company to draw up on the right hand, next to that the Majors, thirdly the ſecond Captains, fourthly the fourth Captains, fifthly the ſixth Captains, ſixthly the ſeventh Captains, ſeventhly the fifth Captains, eighth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the third Captains, ninthly the oldeſt Captain, and laſtly the Lieutenant-Colonels Company. I know ſome would have the Majors Company to be where I have plac'd the youngeſt Captains, becauſe they think next to the Van and the Reer, the middle is the moſt honourable place: But if they take heed they will find it is not ſo with a middle Company as with a middle man in a file, who upon doubling the front by half files, becomes a Leader. Beſides, no Company can properly be ſaid to be in the middle of a Regiment, unleſs the Regiment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of odd Companies, which ſeldom or never is practiſed; for draw up a Regiment of ten Companies in one front, the ſixth Company (which is accounted the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle one) or the Company in the middle of the Regiment is not ſo, for it hath five Companies on its right hand, and but four on its left. Now my reaſon for<note place="margin">Reaſons for the manner of it.</note> drawing up the Companies in that order whereof I have ſpoken, is this: The right hand or the Van is the moſt honourable place, and next to it the left hand or reer. Now the honour comes from danger, which is for moſt part expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Van or the Reer, and hence it will follow that the nearer a Captain and his Company are the danger, the more honourable place they have; and therefore the nearer they are to the Van and the Reer, the more honourable place they have. If then the Regiment be attack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in the Van (where moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is expected) the Majors Company is by much, nearer the danger when it is marſhal'd next to the Colonels, than if it were drawn up about the middle of the Regiment, and conſequently is in the more honourable place; by this ſame reaſon the oldeſt Captain is to be neareſt the Lieutenant-Colonel, who hath the ſecond place of honour; for if the Reer be attackt, the Lieutenant Colonel is
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:97406:124"/> neareſt the danger, and next him the firſt Captain, by this ſame rule of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the ſecond Captain is next to the Major, it being fit ſince the firſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hath the ſecond place of dignity in the Reer, that the ſecond Captain have the third place in the Van. And if this rule hold (as I hope it will) the third Captains Company muſt be drawn up on the oldeſt Captains right hand, that ſo he may have the third place from the Reer, as the ſecond Captain had the third place from the Van. And to make ſhort, I place the fourth Captain in the fourth place from the Van, and the fifth Captain in the fourth place from the Reer, the ſixth Captain in the fifth place from the Van, and the ſeventh and laſt Captain in the fifth place from the Reer. Now becauſe an Enemy is ſooner expected in the Van than in the Reer, the Van is more honourable than the Reer, and therefore I marſhal the laſt Captain in or near the middle of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, where being furtheſt from danger either in Van or Reer, he obtains the place of leaſt dignity, for though all places are honourable, yet ſome are more honourable than others. I marſhal then a Regiment of ten Companies, drawn up in one Diviſion thus:<note place="margin">Order of a Regiment in one Batallion.</note>

                  <p>The Companies ſtanding in this order, the Major will have but little trouble<note place="margin">How to put them in one Body.</note> to Body them, one of two ways: Firſt, he may command all the Pikes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance twenty or twenty four paces, and there join them; then let him cauſe the Muſqueteers of the five Companies on the right, to advance to the right hand of the Pikes, and the Muſqueteers of the five Companies on the left hand to march up to the left hand of the Pikes, and ſo his work is done.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if he have no other ground than that he ſtands on, he is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Pikemen to march thorough the files of the Muſqueteers by the right and left hand, till they meet in one Body in the middle, the Muſqueteers being likewiſe order'd to march by both hands to their due diſtances, ſo that this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a <hi>Chorean</hi> Countermarch of files. This may be done with much eaſe, and a few words, if the Major pleaſe; but ſome have the vanity to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Soldiers more buſineſs than they need by crying this and that, riding here and there, making work to themſelves, and ſometimes ſport to the Beholders.</p>
                  <p>If the Major be order'd to marſhal the Regiment in two Diviſions, he may do<note place="margin">To marſhal a Regiment of ten Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in two Batallions.</note> it thus: The Colonels Company being to have the right hand of the firſt divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the Lieutenant-Colonels of the ſecond Diviſion, he ought to place the other Companies according to their Dignities, and theſe are the Majors Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the Reer of the firſt Diviſion, and the firſt Captains in the Reer of the ſecond Diviſion; the ſecond Captain next to the Colonel in the firſt Diviſion; the third Captain next to the Lieutenant-Colonel in the ſecond Diviſion; the fourth Captain on the right hand of the Major in the firſt Diviſion, and the fifth Captain on the right hand of the oldeſt Captain in the ſecond Diviſion; the ſixth Captain next to the ſecond Captain in the firſt Diviſion; and the ſeventh and laſt Captain next to the third Captain in the ſecond Diviſion.

                  <p>My reaſon for this is, becauſe the Regiment being now divided into two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies or Batallions, the two Reers are next in dignity to the two Vans, and thoſe that are neareſt to the two Reers are next in honour to thoſe who are neareſt to the two Vans; for this reaſon I place the ſixth Captain juſt in the middle of the<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſons for that order.</note> firſt Diviſion, as furtheſt from danger of either Van or Reer of that Diviſion, having two Companies before him, and two behind him, or two on each hand of him. And I place the laſt Captains Company in the middle of the ſecond Diviſion, as the place of leaſt dignity, and that belongs to him, all other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains having the Precedency of him. The Pikes of the firſt and ſecond Diviſions are in the middle of their ſeveral Batallions, and the Muſqueteers of the five Companies of each Body equally divided on both hands of the ſeveral Bodies of the Pikes, which is done in that ſame way as when the Regiment was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal'd in one Diviſion.</p>
                  <p>I know ſome are of opinion that the Majors Company ſhould be in the Reer<note place="margin" type="runSum">Objection againſt that way of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalling,</note> of the Lieutenant-Colonels Diviſion, becauſe the third place of honour in the Regiment belongs to him, and the Colonel having the Van of the firſt Diviſion, and the Lieutenant-Colonel of the ſecond, the Major ſhould have the Reer of the ſecond Diviſion, becauſe it is the Reer of the whole Regiment; I ſhould eaſily ſubſcribe to this if it were not for two reaſons: Firſt, though it be but<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> one Regiment, yet being divided, it ſhould be lookt on as two diſtinct Bodies, and it is more honourable to have the Reer of the firſt, than of the laſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when a Regiment is divided into two parts, the Major ought to wait and lodg at the quarter of that Diviſion of the Regiment where the Colonel is, becauſe from him he receives his Orders, Directions, and the Word, which he is not oblig'd to carry to the Lieutenant-Colonel (if the quarters of the two Diviſions be divided, as many times they are) but the oldeſt Captain is obliged to come and receive them from the Major at the Colonels Quarter, the firſt Captain in that caſe officiating as Major for the Lieutenant-Colonels Batallion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now if the Major ought to be where the Colonel is, as I think he ſhould, then I think the Majors Company ſhould be where himſelf is.</p>
                  <p>The Great <hi>Guſtavus</hi> uſed another way of marſhalling his Regiments and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades of Foot, which taken altogether was not ſquare of front, yet all the four parts or Bodies which compoſed it, were ſquare. The manner was this,<note place="margin">Regiment or Brigade mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal'd a third way,</note> Suppoſe one of his Brigades to be eighteen hundred men (as I can aſſure you he had many weaker) whereof twelve hundred were Muſqueteers, and ſix hundred were Pikemen; the Pikes advanced twenty paces before the two Bodies of Muſqueteers, who immediately join'd to fill up the void place the Pikemen had poſſeſt. Then were the Pikes divided into three equal Bodies, two hundred to each Batallion, the middle Body whereof advanced before the other two ſo far that its Reer might be about ten paces before the Van of the other two. The two Bodies of Pikes that ſtaid behind, were order'd to open a little to both hands, and then ſtand ſtill, all fronting one way to the Enemy; by this means the place which the two hundred Pikes poſſeſt in the middle, remaining void, there were two paſſages like ſally-ports, between the Reer of the advanced Body of Pikes, and the two Batallions that ſtaid behind, out of one whereof on the right hand iſſued conſtantly one or two or more hundreds of Muſqueteers, who before all the three Bodies of Pikes gave inceſſantly fire on the Enemy, and when the word or ſign for a Retreat was given, they retir'd by the other paſſage on the left hand, back to the great Body of Muſqueteers, where ſo many of them as came back unwounded, were preſently put in rank and file, the fire continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without intermiſſion by Muſqueteers, who ſtill ſallied thorough the paſſage on the right hand; and it is to be obſerved that the firemen fought thus in ſmall Bodies, each of them not above five files of Muſqueteers, and theſe for moſt part but three deep. So you may conſider that near the third part of the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers being on ſervice, the other two thirds were ſecurely ſhelter'd behind the three Batallions of Pikemen, who were to be compleatly arm'd for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive. Theſe Pikes had Field pieces with them, which fir'd as oft as they could, as well as the Muſqueteers; this continued till the Pikemen came to puſh of Pike with the Enemy (if both parties ſtaid ſo long, as ſeldom they did) and then the Muſqueteers were to do what they were order'd to do, and the order did depend on emergencies and accidents, which as they could not be then ſeen, ſo
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:97406:125"/> no certain rules could be given for them. In this order did I ſee all the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Brigades drawn up, for one year after the Kings death; but after that time, I ſaw it wear out when Defenſive Arms firſt, and then Pikes came<note place="margin">Worn out.</note> to be neglected, and by ſome vilipended.</p>
                  <p>For the March of a Regiment, if it can all march in one breaſt, it ſhould<note place="margin">The March of a Regiment.</note> do ſo; but if not, and if the ground permit it, let the right hand of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers march in breaſt, next it, the Body of Pikes, and after it the left wing of Muſqueteers. But if none of theſe can be, then as many ſhould march in one petty Diviſion, as the way can permit; as ſuppoſe twelve, eight, or ten, and ſo ſoon as you come to open ground, you are to march preſently in Squadrons, or as they are now called Squads, or in full Battel, that is, the Regiment all in one front; for by that means your Soldiers are readieſt to receive an Enemy, they march in a more comely order, and ſtraggle far leſs than when they march few in breaſt, and in a long row. The Major appoints Captains, Lieutenants, and Enſigns to lead Diviſions, and Serjeants to attend the flanks, every one according to their dignities; but for my own part I never thought it convenient, much leſs neceſſary that every ſmall Diviſion of a Regiment ſhould have a Bringer up, ſince he muſt be (as ſome will have it) a Commiſſion'd Officer, as well as the Leader of a Diviſion ſhould be. For firſt conſider, that in a Regiment of one thouſand ſtrong, there are an hundred ſixty and ſix files, and admit that the way will permit eight files to march in breaſt, (as that falls not always out) by that account you ſhall have one and twenty Diviſions conſiſting of eight Files apiece; multiply twenty one by eight, the Product is a hundred and<note place="margin">Reaſons why every petty Diviſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a Bringer up.</note> ſixty eight Files, which conſiſts of a thouſand and eight men, eight more than the number: Reckon again how many Commiſſion'd Officers you have in ten Companies, beſides the three Field-Officers you ſhall have but twenty nine, now of theſe twenty one muſt be allow'd to lead the Diviſions, and by that account you have but nine Officers to bring up, ſo you want thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Commiſſion'd Officers for that imployment, for Serjeants ſhould neither be permitted to lead or bring up, but in caſe of neceſſity, their duty being to attend the flanks. Beſides, all Commiſſion'd Officers are not always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſome frequently being either ſick, wounded, or abſent on furloff. It will be enough therefore if all theſe petty Diviſions be led by Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd Officers, (which yet cannot be, unleſs you allow ſome Enſign-bearers to ſtay from their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>ours) and by this means you may ſpare ſix foot of ground between two Diviſions; for thoſe who will allow Bringers up, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low eighteen foot between two Diviſions, to wit, ſix foot between the Reer of the firſt Diviſion, and him that brings it up: ſecondly, ſix foot between that Bringer up, and him that leads the next Diviſion, and ſix foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that Leader and the Diviſion he leads. This was the order of the two Princes of <hi>Orange, Maurice</hi> and <hi>Henry.</hi> But if there be no Bringer up, twelve foot will ſerve well enough between Diviſions. Nor am I of their opinion who will have a Colonel of Foot to begin his march on Horſeback; for ſince he commands Foot, he is bound at firſt to march on foot, though afterwards he may ride. And I avouch too, that he who leads Bodies of Foot ſhould not ride at all, becauſe he may very inſenſibly make the Reer run after him. If the Major lead the Regiment, or a part of it in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel<note place="margin">A Major ſtill on Horſeback.</note> and Lieutenant-Colonels abſence, he is bound to do it in Towns, in Leaguers, or at Paſſes on foot, becauſe then he Officiates as Colonel: but if any of his two ſuperior Commanders be preſent, then he ſhould be conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on Horſeback, for being he is not tyed to any one place, but muſt be ſometimes in the Van, ſometimes in the Battel, ſometimes in the Reer, now here, now there, to ſee that every Officer and Soldier do their duty; he ſhould never be on foot when the Regiment marcheth.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the Captain-Lieutenant cannot conſtantly march on foot,<note place="margin">A Captain-Lieutenant.</note> others ſhould be ordain'd to aſſiſt him by turns, and thoſe others ſhould be Captains, for by the courteſie of Arms the Captain-Lieutenant is youngeſt Captain. But this aſſiſtance he is to get, is only in the Field, for ſo ſoon as he comes near to Town, Village, or Quarter, he is to march on the head of the Regiment behind one of the three Field Officers, and all the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:97406:126"/> Captains ought to go immediately to their ſeveral Diviſions.</p>
                  <p>It hath been a cuſtom of a long time, and in many places, to put ſeveral Regiments in one Body or Batallion, which they call a Brigade. There are of<note place="margin">A Brigade.</note> theſe both of Horſe and Foot, and the Colonel, who commands that Body, is called a Brigadeer. It is not as yet defin'd, for any thing I know, how ſtrong a Brigade ſhould be, three thouſand, two thouſand, eighteen hundred, or fifteen hundred. The Eſtates of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> had always Brigades of Foot in their Service, but thoſe were ſtrong, five or ſix thouſand. I have ſeen ſix Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in one Brigade, and yet it did not conſiſt of ſo many as two thouſand men that carried Arms; here you may ſuppoſe there were Officers enough for ſo few Soldiers. The Colonel who is oldeſt in that ſervice commands the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade. There is likewiſe a Major of the Brigade, who receives the Word and other Orders from the Major-General, and gives them to the Majors of the other Regiments of the Brigade, and they to their Colonels and Lieutenant-Colonels, and then to the Serjeants of all the ſeveral Companies. This Major of the Brigade is ordinarily he who is Major of the oldeſt Regiment of that Brigade.</p>
                  <p>When a Brigade marcheth, the Regiments of it have the Van-day about by turns, but ſo have not the Companies of the ſeveral Regiments. It ſeems ſomething ſtrange to me that a Regiment of one thouſand Foot ſhould be divided into two ſeveral Bodies, the Colonel, and Lieutenant Colonels Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and yet that Regiment Embodied with another, perhaps with other two, and march all in one Body. Truly I ſhould think if the firſt be needful, the ſecond ſhould not be neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>It is a cuſtom with ſome Princes to give ſome of their Colonels more Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<note place="margin">Colonels of two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> than one, which I have ſeen, though I confeſs I never ſaw any good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it; for if a Prince or a State will advance a Colonel above or beyond his fellows, he may rather give him ſome higher title, and conſequently grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pay; yet it were the more tollerable if both Regiments were of Foot, or both of Horſe, for then they might make up a Brigade, and he who is Colonel of both, might be Brigadeer of both. But I have known ſome of them Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels of Horſe and Foot, and ſure they cannot Officiate in both Regiments at one time, and therefore I confeſs that in one of them a Lieutenant-Colonel is very neceſſary. But it muſt miniſter ſome fuel of heart-burning to many brave Gentlemen, who have ſerved Princes faithfully, to ſee ſome men provided with two Charges who have done no more than themſelves, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of Troops, and Regiments of Horſe, of their Officers, and of Dragoons.</head>
                  <p>THOSE who ſerve in the Wars on Horſeback, are by a general word called the Cavalry, which is now underſtood in all Languages, though it be deriv'd either from the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>Chevall,</hi> or the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> word <hi>Cavallo,</hi> both which ſignifie a Horſe. Though the <hi>Germans</hi> make much uſe of the word Cavalry, yet they have one of their own as proper and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficative as it is, and that is <hi>Reutery.</hi> We have no other word for it in <hi>Engliſh</hi> but what is borrowed from the <hi>French.</hi> It hath been in ancient times a noble ſervice, and ſtill ſhould be ſo; for as I obſerved before, thoſe who ſerved on Horſeback, eſpecially the men at Arms or Curiaſſiers, were all Gentlemen, and moſt of them of a high extraction; but now a promiſcuous levy by the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet hath well near abrogated that commendable cuſtom, and made men of all ſorts (ſo they be of bodies fit for ſervice) whatever their birth be, welcome to ride in Troops. When the <hi>Romans</hi> ſaid, a man was <hi>equeſtris ordinis,</hi> they meant he was a Gentleman; and when they ſpoke ſo, it was nothing elſe but that he was of that rank or claſs, out of which Horſemen were choſen to ſerve in the<note place="margin">Cavalry of old challeng'd with reaſon the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the Infantry.</note> Wars. This made them with much reaſon demand as their due, the precedency of the Foot, though ſtill the Infantry be the ſtrength of the Army, but now that Horſemen are Plebeians as well as Footmen; the hand and the door is no more due to the one, not to the other; and in many places Commanders of Horſe and Foot, who carry alike Offices, take the precedency according to their antiquity of bearing charge. But in moſt Courts and Councils of War<note place="margin">And hath it yet.</note> (by the determination of the Prince) the Officers of the Cavalry have ſeats gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them before thoſe of the Infantry, neither do the laſt contend for it.</p>
                  <p>It was near the time of the Emperours, before the <hi>Romans</hi> had any light arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Curiaſſiers.</note> Horſemen, but almoſt with all other Nations, and in all times, a Cavalry was divided into heavy and light armed, and they are called ſo from their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Arms, the heavy arm'd are called Curiaſſiers, <hi>Gens d'Armes,</hi> and men at Arms from their defenſive armour, but the light armed are now called Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuſiers from their offenſive weapon; the Harquebuſs which before the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Muſquet and Piſtol, was a weapon (only differing in length) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both the Foot and the Horſe, and they had both their denomination of<note place="margin">Harquebuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers why ſo called.</note> Harquebuſiers from it. And though none of them now uſe the Harquebuſs; and that the Foot-firemen are called Muſqueteers from the Muſquet, yet the light Horſe, though they uſe Piſtols, keep ſtill the old name of Harquebuſiers.</p>
                  <p>What Arms both for offence and defence both thoſe kinds of Horſemen had formerly, and what now they have, is formerly told you in ſeveral Diſcourſes.</p>
                  <p>It hath been of late a cuſtom to arm the light Horſemen with Carrabines<note place="margin">Carrabine,</note> hung about their ſhoulders in Leather Bandileers, beſides their Piſtols, ſo that upon the matter, whole Troops are ſo armed with Carrabines, that you may call them Carrabineers, but it was not ſo in former times, for only a preſcrib'd number of them were ordain'd to attend every Troop of Curiaſſiers, and had no Officers of their own, the manner of their ſervice was to ride up within ſuch a diſtance as they were order'd, and diſcharge their Carrabines on the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and immediately turn to either hand by a Caragoll, and get them behind the Troop, and this they were oblig'd to do, as oft as they were commanded to it by him who was Captain of the Company of Curiaſſiers. Hence it is that<note place="margin">Why ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> the Lord <hi>Carbouſine</hi> tells us that Carrabine is a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> word deriv'd from <hi>Cara,</hi> which ſignifies a face; and <hi>Bino</hi> which ſignifies twofold, as one would ſay, double fac'd, becauſe the Carrabineer kept his face to his enemy, till he had fired his piece, and then turn'd his face to his friends when he Caragol'd.</p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:97406:127"/>
                  <p>Seventy or eighty years ago there were no Regiments of Horſe (properly ſo<note place="margin">In former times there were only Troops, but no Regiments of Horſe.</note> called) only Troops or Companies, and theſe ſometimes were two hundred ſtrong, ſometimes one hundred, and ſometimes not ſo many, and upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſervice, Troops were join'd together, and the command of ſome of them given for a time by the Prince or State to ſome perſon of great quality, whom they thought fit for that imployment. Sometimes three Troops were join'd together, ſometimes five or ſix, yet they had not the name of a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor had he who commanded that Body ſo compoſed, the title of Colonel. The Eſtates of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> uſed this much, but now they levy Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The furious Wars which began in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in the year of our Lord 1618, (whereof in proceſs of time we had a deep ſhare at home) reverſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good old cuſtoms and conſtitutions, and with other changes introduced Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Horſe, and not only ſo, but brought in ſuch numbers of them that in many Armies there were near as many Regiments of Horſe as of Foot; yea;<note place="margin">Numerous Regiments of Horſe.</note> I have ſeen in more Armies than one, a greater number of Horſe-Regiments than of Foot. Inſomuch that ſome years before the Peace of <hi>Munſter,</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Horſe were ſo weak that the Officers of the ſeveral Troops being all in the Van, did near make a full rank equal in number to any of the three ranks behind them, which were compoſed of Riders or Troopers. And becauſe in Battel, Officers by their courage give good example, this helpt well to make the Regiments and Troops fight well, and upon this account I aver that theſe Regiments conſiſted rather of four ranks, than of three, and ſo were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly three deep. But let us look a little further back, yet not beyond the time that Piſtols came in requeſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Cavalry even in <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth's time, and the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Juſt, was compoſed of three kinds, theſe were <hi>Gens d'Armes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>French</hi> Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> Archers, and light Horſe. How the <hi>Gens d'Armes</hi> were mounted and arm'd hath been told you; and theſe were uſed by the ancient <hi>Gauls</hi> before ever the <hi>Roman</hi> name was known among them, and were called <hi>Clupeati.</hi> Theſe latter<note place="margin">Clupeati.</note> 
                     <hi>Gens d'Armes,</hi> or Curiaſſiers, were all order'd in ſeveral Troops, but not in Regiments; theſe Troops were all to be compoſed of Gentlemen by their birth, and were not of equal ſtrength, they were of two kinds, for ſome were in the<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gens d'Armes</hi> of two kinds.</note> Kings pay, ſome not. Thoſe entertain'd by the King, were called <hi>Des Ordon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances du Roy,</hi> or of the Kings Eſtabliſhment. Some of them conſiſted of one hundred Gentlemen, ſome of ſixty, ſome of fifty, and ſome of forty, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the quality or merit of the Captain, or the pleaſure of the Prince. The <hi>French</hi> Troops of <hi>Gens d'Armes,</hi> which were not in the Kings pay, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of thoſe Gentlemen who were obliged to ſerve on their own charges three months within the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and forty days without it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> Archers before the time of Gunpowder carried Bows and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,<note place="margin">Archers.</note> and from thence had the name of Archers; but at this time of which I ſpeak, they had for weapons, Piſtols, Swords, Maces, or half Lances. Thoſe who were called <hi>Chevaux Legers,</hi> or light Horſe, had much the like Arms, but<note place="margin">Light Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> inſtead of a Piſtol, each had a Harquebuſs hanging at his Saddle. The main difference between theſe two conſiſted in this, that the Archers compoſed no ſeveral or diſtinct body of the Cavalry, but were to attend the <hi>Gens d'Armes,</hi> for every man of Arms had the allowance of an Archer to wait on him; ſo that how ſtrong ſoever the Company of the <hi>Gens d'Armes</hi> was, of that ſame num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<note place="margin">The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between an Archer, and a light Horſeman.</note> were the Archers that attended it. But the Cavalry <hi>Legere,</hi> or the light Horſe were not at all obliged to any ſuch attendance, but had a General of their own who marſhal'd them, who march'd with them, and fought with them, either as he himſelf thought good, or as he was order'd to do by the Great Conſtable, or one of the Marſhals of <hi>France.</hi> And aſſuredly the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Archers to attend the men at Arms was excellent, for the Curiaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers not being able to Caragol, are obliged in their charge to break thorough, or be beaten; and in any of theſe caſes, the Archers were of good uſe: If they were worſted to ſupport them, or to purſue the enemy when he was put to flight, which the men at Arms could not do, becauſe of the weight of their Armour. Now all theſe three, <hi>Gens d'Armes,</hi> Archers, and light Horſemen,<note place="margin">How many Horſes all three were oblig'd to keep.</note> were obliged to keep each of them more Horſes than one; whereas now our Troopers are obliged to keep no more but one, and have allowance of pay little enough for that one.</p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:97406:127"/>
                  <p>I find, that in the Wars which the Proteſtants of <hi>France</hi> made with their Kings,<note place="margin">In the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant War, in <hi>France</hi> 100 years ago<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, and his Brother <hi>Henry</hi> the Third; they managed them at as ſmall an expence, as poſſibly they could; yet they obliged every man at Arms, to keep three Horſes, two ſtrong Courſers, and one Gelding; every Archer, and Light-Horſe-man, two, a good Horſe, and a good Nag. And I ſuppoſe, you will really think it ſtrange, how they could keep ſo many, when I tell you what allowance of pay they had: Every man of Arms had 45 <hi>French</hi> Livres in the Month, about Three pound fifteen ſhillings Sterling; every Archor and Light-Horſe-man had Thirty Livres, about Two pound ten ſhillings. A Captain of all three had five Riders pay allow'd him, the Lieutenant four, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net three, and the Quartermaſter two: very inconſiderable wages, but aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they had either other ſhifts, or things were at eaſier rates in <hi>France</hi> then, than they have been ſince.</p>
                  <p>In the times of the Emperours <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Firſt, <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Second, <hi>Rodolph</hi> the Second, and <hi>Matthias,</hi> I find that the <hi>German</hi> Eſtabliſhment was,<note place="margin">Old <hi>German</hi> Companies of Horſe, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Curiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers.</note> that no Ritmaſter, or Captain of Horſe ſhould have any Rider in his Troop but Gentlemen, and that every Troop of Curiaſſiers ſhould conſiſt of Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hundred Riders, many whereof were bound to maintan three ſerviceable Horſes, and all the reſt, two at leaſt; and every one of theſe Gentlemen who kept ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two or three Horſes, were to keep a luſty fellow well Hors'd, in quality of a ſervant, armed with a long Gun, wherewith they rode, when command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before the Troop, and fired on the Enemy, and immediately retired behind the Troop, as I told you, the Carabineers did, theſe being equal in number to their Maſters, made up Three hundred, and reſembled the <hi>French</hi> Archers. Theſe <hi>Dutch</hi> Servants had the Emperours pay, or that of ſome <hi>German</hi> Prince, but their Maſters received it, with their own; nor had the Maſters power to put away theſe Servants, or the Servants to go from the Maſters, ſo long as the War laſted; but if any difference aroſe between them, it was voided by the Ritmaſter, or Marſhal of the Army. Theſe <hi>German</hi> Companies of Horſe had for Officers a Captain, a Lieutenant, a Cornet, a Quartermaſter,<note place="margin">Their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</note> and ſix Corporals, whom they called Ritmaſters (which is to ſay, File-lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) each whereof had fifty Troops under his command; two Trumpeters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There was likewiſe allowed to every Troop, a Prieſt, a Clerk, a Chirurgion, a Dagmaker, a Saddler, and a Smith. All theſe Curiaſſiers were armed for offence with two Piſtols, a Sword, and a Lance; ſo long as this laſt was in faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo if you will reckon all that belonged to this <hi>German</hi> Troop, both Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and thoſe who attended them (who were all obliged to fight) you will find it conſiſted of ſix hundred fighting men, and of nine hundred Horſes at leaſt. But ſince that time I have ſeen four Regiments in that ſame Country, who were not all of them together ſo ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>In later times, Commiſſions have been given for levying Regiments, free Squads, and Troops, but all Regiments did not, nor do not conſiſt of alike<note place="margin">Troops and Regiment of thoſe times.</note> number of Companies, nor all Companies of alike number of Riders, nay, not under one Prince, you ſhall ſee a Lieutenant Colonel have four Troops in his Squadron (which he calls free) becauſe he acknowledgeth no Colonel, or other Commander under the Major General, and each of theſe Troops to have fifty or ſixty Riders, being oblig'd to have no more by their Ritmaſters Capitulation: You may ſee in that ſame Army a Regiment of ſix Companies, each of Seventy men; another of eight Troops, each of fifty horſe, ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is an uniformity in equal numbers of Troops, or of Horſemen in every Troop regarded, or look'd after. I ſaw one Regiment in the <hi>Sweediſh</hi> ſervice (I may ſay one, for I ſaw not ſuch another in any of their Armies) in which were according to Capitulation, twelve Troops, each of them conſiſting of one hundred Riders effectively, but four of the Regiments of that Army were not ſo ſtrong, as that Regiment was alone.</p>
                  <p>Troops, Squads, and Regiments of Horſe in our Modern Wars, are not caſt into Wedges or Rhombs as ſome of the Ancient ones were, at which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of figures <hi>Aelian</hi> makes his <hi>Grecian</hi> Companies to be very dexterous: The Square front being now only in uſe. The number of Ranks of either Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Troops, whether they be ſtrong or weak, are alike in all, becauſe the depth of the Battel is determined by the Prince or State to be alike in all, and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:97406:128"/> in the matter of this depth there hath been great variance among thoſe, who aſſume to themſelves the title of Tacticks, who teach the rules of War. Many would have the file of Horſemen to be five deep; others will not hear of<note place="margin">How deep Horſe ſhould be marſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Others will have ſix, becauſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits doubling of ranks, but that is rejected, becauſe if ſix deep be enough for the Foot, it will be too much for the Horſe. There be others who would have every Troop of Horſe to conſiſt of ſixty and four Riders, and theſe being Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall'd eight deep, and eight in front according to the ſquare root, make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſquare of men and Horſe, and this ſpeculation ſeems very pretty, but I<note place="margin">Square Root.</note> reſerve my anſwer to it till I ſpeak of the ſquare root it ſelf; for the preſent let it ſuffice, that if ſix deep be too many for a Cavalry, eight deep will be very far out of purpoſe. The late Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> as he appointed, in his Military Inſtructions, the foot to be eight deep, ſo he order'd his Troops of Horſe to be four in File. But Univerſally now, for any thing I know (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be in the Low-Countries) the Horſe are Marſhall'd three deep, without<note place="margin">Three deep.</note> regard to doubling of ranks, whereof I have already ſpoken; and aſſuredly, this of all others, brings moſt hands to fight.</p>
                  <p>When you have known how deep the Troop is to be drawn up, you ſhould cauſe to be ſet down in paper, in what order you will Marſhal your Horſemen: whom you ordain to be Leaders, and whom Bringers up, and whom for the right and left hand files, that all your Riders may be placed according to their dignity, then it will be an eaſie matter to draw up your Troop, and for the Major to draw up the Regiment; for being that all the Horſemen are arm'd alike, there is no ſeparation to be made of one part of the Troop from another, as there is of ſeparating the Pikem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n from the Muſqueteers in Foot-Companies, the Major giving every Ritmaſter his place of dignity according to his antiquity or Commiſſion; and thoſe intervals being kept that are appointed, the ſeveral Troops, be they few or many, are very ſoon caſt into the mould of a Regiment.</p>
                  <p>In my diſcourſe of drilling, I ſaid, that in exerciſing a Body of Horſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one Troop or more, ſome allow for order ſix foot, ſome, ten, and for open order ſome allow twelve foot, and ſome twenty, others conclude ſix<note place="margin">Diſtance.</note> foot between rank and rank, and file and file ſufficient, but in marching there ſhould be the length of a Horſe between rank and rank, but ſo much is not at all needful between files: now it ſeems the <hi>Germans</hi> allow ten foot for the length of a Horſe in marching and exerciſing, as well as in their Caſtrameta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for when Horſe are orderly quarter'd in the field, ten foot of ground are allowed for a Horſe to ſtand on between his head and his tail. But for all this, I ſay, ſix foot are not to be allowed in all motions of exerciſe, as in Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is the poper motion of the Cavalry, you cannot make it, till your ranks and files be at cloſe order, and in this motion of Wheeling, obſerve, that the Wheeling to the left hand, being the Bridle hand, is more proper, than<note place="margin">Wheeling.</note> to the right: Obſerve alſo that after your body hath Wheel'd you are to reduce them to their firſt order, by making the ranks open, which they muſt do by advancing, and not by ſtepping back as the foot do.</p>
                  <p>The ſtronger the Troop be, it ſhould have the more Corporals, who begin now to be qualified with the Title of Brigadeers, for it ſeems not proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for a Troop of One Hundred and Twenty to have no more Corporals, than a Troop of ſixty, or ſeventy, yet for moſt part now all Troops have a like number of Officers, and theſe are, the Captain or Ritmaſter, The Lieutenant, the Cornet, the Quartermaſter, three Corporals or Brigadeers, two Trumpeters, ſome have three, and ſome four, a Saddler, and a Smith, and ſome allow a Chirurgion, and a Clerk. Many Troops have no allowance, for the laſt four, though all four<note place="margin">Officers of a Troop.</note> are very neceſſary; In ſome places, if a Chirurgion be allowed for every Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is thought very fair, many Ritmaſters entertain a Saddler and a Smith in their Troops, allowing them the pay of Troopers, and what benefit elſe they can make by their ſeveral Trades. But if all who ride in the Troop be Gentlemen, they will not permit theſe two Mechanicks to ride with them; yet my opinion is, ſince all who ride now in Troops are not Gentlemen, they may without any diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, ſuffer a Smith and a Saddler to ride in rank with them, being they are profitable members of that little Commonwealth. It is, I think an overſight, that a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:97406:128"/> Clerk is not allow'd for every Company of Horſe; for a Quarter maſter hath enough to doth otherwiſe, though he be not bound to officiate for the Clerk, to receive the Pay of the Troop, and give it out, and keep the accounts of it; unleſs you will ſay, that the paying Money to a Troop falls out ſo ſeldom, that the receiving it, will be rather a divertiſement than a trouble to the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termaſter.</p>
                  <p>Having ſpoke to the Duties of a Captain, Lieutenant, and Enſign-bearer of a Foot Company, I have nothing to add to the Duties of a Ritmaſter, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, and Cornet, but between the Quartermaſters of Foot and Horſe there is this difference, that the firſt hath no command, but the ſecond hath, in<note place="margin">Quarter-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Horſe.</note> other duties there is none. But I ſhall tell the Quatermaſters of Horſe, that they ſhould have skill in Caſtrametation, as much as the Foot Quartermaſters have, and rather more; for the laſt look only to the regular quartering of Men in the Field, the firſt to the quartering of both Men and Horſes. A Corporal<note place="margin">Corporals, of Brigadeers.</note> of Horſe ſhould have experience, for he either aſſiſts the Lieutenant in placing and ſetting the Guards, or he doth it himſelf without his Lieutenant, he ſets the Sentinels, and ſees them reliev'd; and orders the <hi>Patrovils,</hi> which are Rounds. He is to ride in Rank, and if the Troop march not in breaſt, but in three ſeveral Squadrons, then there is a Corporal on the right hand of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Squadron; but in abſence of higher Officers, Corporals lead Diviſions, ſo do they thoſe parties which they are to command, if there be none to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand above them.</p>
                  <p>When a Troop is divided into three Squadrons, they have not their deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations from the Corporals or Brigadeers, but the firſt is called the Captains Squadron, the ſecond the Lieutenants, the third the Cornets, and if there be a fourth, it is called the Quartermaſters. When a Troop marcheth, the<note place="margin">March of a Troop.</note> Captain leads the firſt diviſion, the Cornet with his Standard the ſecond, the Quartermaſter leads the third, and the Lieutenant brings up; yet ſome will have the eldeſt Corporal to lead the laſt diviſion, and the Quartermaſter to bring up on the Lieutenants left hand, for which I ſee very ſmall reaſon, or rather none at all. Some <hi>French</hi> Troops and ours likewiſe, have beſides theſe Officers whom I have nam'd, a Sub-Lieutenant, or under Lieutenant, who<note place="margin">Sub-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> hath no command in the Lieutenants preſence, but in his abſence he commands over the Cornet; the <hi>French</hi> have likewiſe a <hi>Guidon,</hi> to whom perhaps may<note place="margin">Guidon.</note> anſwer he who in other places is appointed to carry the Standard, either in the Cornets abſence, or when he pleaſeth to appoint him to carry it. As to the Officers of the Regiment-Staff of the Cavalry, they are the ſame with thoſe of the Foot, and their Duties are the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But now methinks I hear a Trumpeter ſound a Call. Of Trumpets and of Trumpeters I have ſpoke in my Diſcourſes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Art of War: That which I have now to add, is, Trumpeters ſhould be skilful to ſound all the<note place="margin">Trumpeters.</note> points of War, and in the Fields they ſhould ſeldom want their Trumpets about them for ſudden Alarms: And becauſe they are frequently ſent to an Enemy, they ought to be both witty and diſcreet, and muſt drink but little, that ſo they may be rather apt to circumvent others, than be circumvented; they ſhould be cunning, and whereever they are ſent, they ſhould be careful to obſerve warily the Works, Guards, and Sentinels of an Enemy, and give an account of them at their return to him who ſent them. One Trumpeter ſhould conſtantly lodge where the Standard quarters. The <hi>German</hi> Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters aſſume to themſelves a great deal of liberty, and have in a manner ſet up<note place="margin">Pretended priviledges of the <hi>German</hi> Trumpeters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> a Republick of their own, independent of that Diſcipline, by which the Army (of which they are members) is governed. They pretend to have their own Laws, whereby they puniſh crimes very ſeverely, eſpecially ſuch faults, that any of their number commits againſt the Articles of War of that Prince whom they ſerve; and endeavour to vindicate themſelves from any puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by others, than thoſe of their own Common-wealth. If any Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be abus'd or diſgrac'd, whether by his own Ritmaſter, or any other Officer, the reſt reſent it, as an injury done to the whole fraternity; for which they will very readily make him march a whole week without a Trumpeter to ſound before him. None may ſound a Trumpet before a Troop but he who is maſter of their Art, and he muſt prove himſelf to be ſo, by produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:97406:129"/> a Certificate, ſign'd by a certain number of Maſter Trumpeters, with their Seals annexed to it, and this in their Language, they call a <hi>Lerbrief:</hi> If any, wanting this, offer to ſound before a Company of Horſe, the Maſters may come and take him away with diſgrace, in ſpite of the Ritmaſter. Thoſe who have not yet got <hi>Lerbriefs,</hi> they call Boys, who muſt ſerve the Maſter Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peters in all manner of drudgery, though they could ſound all the points of War never ſo well. They pretend to have got theſe priviledges from the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, under his Manual Subſcription and Imperial Seal. Ask them where this Patent of theirs lyeth, ſome of them will tell you at <hi>Augsburg,</hi> others ſay at <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and a third will ſay at <hi>Nuremburg.</hi> I have not ſeen any of them puniſhed by their Officers, and whatever diſcipline of their own they have I know not, but I have not heard of any of their groſs miſdemeaners. I knew one Colonel <hi>Boy,</hi> an ancient Gentleman, who for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years had commanded Horſe, in whoſe Regiment no ſound of Trumpet was heard, for none of them would ſerve under him, becauſe in his younger years he had kill'd a Trumpeter with his own hand. But it is well theſe pretended priviledges of theirs are confin'd within the bounds of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire.</p>
                  <p>There is another Martial Inſtrument uſed with the Cavalry, which they call a Kettle-drum, there be two of them which hang upon the Horſe before the<note place="margin">Kettle-drum.</note> Drummers Saddle, on both which he beats: They are not ordinary, Princes, Dukes, and Earls, may have them with thoſe Troops which ordinarily are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their Life-guards, ſo may Generals and Lieutenant Generals, though they be not Noble-men. The <hi>Germans, Danes</hi> and <hi>Sweedes,</hi> permit none to have them under a Lord Baron, unleſs they have taken them from an Enemy, and in that caſe any Ritmaſter, whatever extraction he be of, may make them beat beſide his Trumpeters. They are uſed alſo for State by the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> when they go to meat, and I have ſeen them ordinarily beat, and Trumpets ſound at the Courts of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> when either of the two Kings went to Dinner or Supper.</p>
                  <p>Dragoons are Musketeers mounted on Horſes, appointed to march with the<note place="margin">Dragoons</note> Cavalry, in regard there are not only many occaſions, wherein Foot can aſſiſt the Horſe, but that ſeldome there is any occaſion of ſervice againſt an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but wherein it is both fit and neceſſary to joyn ſome Foot with the Horſe, Dragoons then go not only before to guard Paſſes (as ſome imagine) but to fight in open Field; for if an Enemy rencounter with a Cavalry in a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign or open Heath, the Dragoons are obliged to alight, and mix themſelves with the Squads of Horſe, as they ſhall be commanded; and their continuate Firing, before the Horſe come to the charge, will, no doubt, be very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Enemy: If the encounter be in a cloſe Countrey, they ſerve well to line Hedges, and poſſeſs Encloſures, they ſerve for defending Paſſes and Bridges, whether it be in the Advance, or a Retreat of an Army, and for<note place="margin">Serve on foot,</note> beating the Enemy from them: Their ſervice is on foot, and is no other than that of Musketeers; but becauſe they are mounted on Horſe-back, and ride with the Horſe, either before in the Van, or behind in the Rear of an Army, they are reckon'd as a part of the Cavalry, and are ſubordinate to the<note place="margin">Yet are part of the Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> General, Lieutenant General, or Major General of the Horſe, and not to thoſe of the foot. And being that ſometimes they are forced to retire from a powerful and prevailing Enemy, they ought to be taught to give Fire on Horſe-back, that in an open field they may keep an Enemy at a diſtance till they get the advantage of a cloſer Countrey, a Straight, a Paſs, a Bridge, a Hedge, or a Ditch, and then they are bound to alight, and defend that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that thereby (though perhaps with the loſs of the Dragoons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) the Cavalry may be ſaved. When they alight, they caſt their Bridle Reins over the necks of their ſide-mens Horſes, and leave them in that ſame order as they marched. Of ten Dragoons, nine fight, and the tenth man keeps the ten Horſes. For what they have got the denomination of Dragoons,<note place="margin">Whence they have their denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> is not ſo eaſie to be told, but becauſe in all languages they are called ſo, we may ſuppoſe they may borrow their name from <hi>Dragon,</hi> becauſe a Musketeer on Horſe back, with his burning Match riding at a gallop, as many times he doth, may ſomething reſemble that Beaſt, which Naturaliſts call a Fiery Dragon.</p>

If the ſervice with the enemy be in the Van, as moſtly it is,<note place="margin">Muſqueteers after firing fall off two ſeveral ways<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> ranks may (after they have fired) fall off two ſeveral ways: Firſt, the rank which hath fired, divides it ſelf into two, and the half goes to the right hand, and the other half to the left, and then they fall down to the reer, and ſo of Leaders become Bringers-up, till another rank comes behind them. But I<note place="margin">The firſt not at all good.</note> would have this manner of falling off baniſht out of all armies, for in a great Body it breeds confuſion, and though in drilling it may leiſurely be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſiderable diſorder, yet in ſervice with an enemy, where men are falling, it procures a pitiful Embarras, and though it did not, yet it ought to<note place="margin">The ſecond good.</note> give way to a more eaſie way of falling off, which is the ſecond way I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to tell you of, and it is that I ſpoke of, of falling down by the Intervals of ground, that is between files, and this I would have conſtantly done by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the left-hand after they have fired, becauſe after that Muſqueteers reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Matches, and caſt about their Muſquets to the left-ſide, that they may charge again, which they are a doing, while they fall off to the reer. But<note place="margin">But not at all to fall off is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is not poſſible that by this way of giving fire, there can be the leaſt confuſion, or any thing like it, if Officers be but half men; there is another way of firing ſometimes practiſed, that is by three ranks together, the firſt kneeling, the ſecond ſtooping, and the third ſtanding, theſe having fired, the other three ranks march thorough the firſt three, and in the ſame poſtures fire likewiſe. But here I ſhall deſire it to be granted to me that which indeed is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable,<note place="margin">Three ranks to fire at one time, and then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three.</note> that when the laſt three ranks have fired, the firſt three cannot be ready to fire the ſecond time. Next, firing by three ranks at a time, ſhould not be practiſed, but when either the buſineſs ſeems to be deſperate, or that the Bodies are ſo near, that the Pikemen are almoſt come to puſh of Pike, and then no other uſe can be made of the Muſquet but of the Butt-end of it. I ſay then<note place="margin">Not ſo good as all ſix ranks to fire at once.</note> that this manner of ſix ranks to fire at two ſeveral times is not at all to be uſed; for if it come to extremity, it will be more proper to make them all fire at once, for thereby you pour as much Lead in your enemies boſom at one time as you do the other way at two ſeveral times, and thereby you do them more miſchief, you quail, daunt, and aſtoniſh them three times more, for one long and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated crack of Thunder is more terrible and dreadful to mortals than ten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted and ſeveral ones, though all and every one of the ten be as loud as the long one.

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:97406:130"/> ſome of his Brigades to fire all at once by kneeling, ſtooping, and ſtanding, which produced effects conform to his deſire. If you ask me how ſix ranks can fire all at one time, and level their Muſquets right? I ſhall tell you the foremoſt three<note place="margin">How to do it.</note> ranks muſt firſt be doubled by half files, and then your Body conſiſts but of three ranks, and the poſture of the firſt is kneeling, of the ſecond ſtooping, and of the third ſtanding, and then you may command them all to fire.</p>
                  <p>If you command your ranks (after they have fired) to fall to the reer any of the two ways already ſpoken of, though you take never ſo good heed, you ſhall loſe ground, beſides that it hath the ſhow of a retreat, but by making the ranks ſucceſſively go before thoſe which have fired, you advance ſtill, and gain ground. In this order ſhould Dragoons fight in open field, when they are mixed<note place="margin">How Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons ſhould fire, and fall off.</note> with Horſe, in this order alſo ſhould they fire and advance when they intend to beat an enemy from a Paſs. But when they are to defend a Paſs, a Bridg, or a Strait, they muſt then after firing fall off to the reer, by marching thorough the Intervals of their ſeveral files, becauſe it may be ſuppoſed they have no ground whereon they can advance.</p>

                     <hi>Martinet</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Marſhal <hi>de Camp</hi> tells us of another manner of firing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from all theſe that I have mentioned, as thus: Of ſix ranks of Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers he would have the firſt five to kneel, the ſixth to ſtand and fire firſt, then the fifth to riſe and fire next, and conſecutively the reſt, till the firſt rank have fired, after which he will have the foremoſt five ranks to kneel again, till the ſixth diſcharge, if the ſervice laſt ſo long. By this way you can gain no ground, and I think its very fair if you keep the ground you have, for I conceive you may probably loſe it, and which is worſe, the ranks which kneel before that which gives fire, may be in greater fear of their friends behind them, than of their enemies before them, and good reaſon for it, in regard when men are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving death to others, and in expectation of the ſame meaſure from thoſe who ſtand againſt them, they are not ſo compoſed nor govern'd with ſo ſteady rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as when they are receiving leiſurely leſſons in cold blood, how to pour Lead in their enemies boſoms. But I have ſpoke of this in another place, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more than becomes a private perſon, ſince I find that manner of giving fire is practiſed in the <hi>French</hi> Armies by order of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>In the marſhalling of Regiments, Brigades, Companies, and Troops either of Horſe or Foot, Commanders, muſt be very cautious when they have to do with an enemy, not to charge the ordinary forms, for if at that time you offer to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce any new form wherewith your men are not acquainted, you ſhall not fail to put them in ſome confuſion, than which an enemy cannot deſire a greater<note place="margin">New figures of Battels commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> advantage. If you have a new figure of a Battel in your head, be ſure to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom your Companies and Regiment very often by exerciſe to the practice of it, before you make uſe of it in earneſt. But by this, let me not ſeem to put a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint on any ingenious ſpirit that is capable to create new figures, I think they ſhould be exceedingly cheriſht by Princes and their Generals, and ſuch of them as are approv'd by them ſhould be practiſed. The old <hi>Romans</hi> indeed kept themſelves moroſely to their ancient forms, whereby they had been exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proſperous, and call'd all new Inventions <hi>Schematiſms.</hi> But we are not bound to follow them in all their opinions, for I am of <hi>Lipſius</hi> his judgment, <hi>Valde mihi placent nova, &amp; novitia iſtae Inventiuncula:</hi> Theſe little new Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">To be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed with much cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ſaith he, pleaſe me mightily.

And to this purpoſe he himſelf ſpeaks very well towards the end of his Book, and with his words I ſhall cloſe this Chapter. <q rend="inline">The ſubſtantial and ſolid things of War, are to be preciſely regarded, without which an Army, though of the moſt valiant men, will be expoſed to the greateſt dangers, and will fall into a moſt certain ruin.</q>

                  <p>Muſqueteers on Horſeback are called Dragoons in all Languages from the word <hi>Dragon,</hi> becauſe when they are mounted on Horſes, and riding with burning Matches (eſpecially in the night time) they reſemble fiery <hi>Dragons</hi> flying in the air, but now that in ſome places Dragooners Muſquets are converted into Carabines (a change not to be deſpiſed, if the Carabine can ſend a Bullet as far
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:97406:130"/> as a Muſquet) I conceive they may rather be called Carabineers than Dragoons. In <hi>France</hi> the Lieutenant of Horſe marcheth now on the left hand of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or Ritmaſter, four or five foot nearer the Troop, an Innovation, as many other cuſtoms are, againſt which I have little to ſay, or rather juſt nothing.</p>

                     <p>The firſt queſtion ſhall be this, which of the two Officers of equal quality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both under one Prince or State, the one of Horſe, the other of Foot ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in chief, having no Superior at that time above them, ſuppoſing thoſe who are to be commanded conſiſt of both Foot and Horſe. The ſecond Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ſhall be, whether an Officer of an inferiour quality may upon occaſion command one of a higher degree: As whether a Lieutenant may command a Captain? The queſtion is ſubdivided into two: As firſt, whether an Officer of Horſe, of an inferiour quality, may command an Officer of Foot of a higher degree? And next, whether an Officer of a King, Prince, State, or Generals Guards, ought or may have the command above an Officer of a Superiour qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in any other Regiment of the Army? Suppoſe a Lieutenant of the Guards of Foot to command over any Captain of another Regiment of Foot, and the like of the Horſe, there may fall out a thouſand emergences and occaſions for ſuch encounters, and therefore they would be obviated and provided for by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and punctual orders. As ſuppoſe, which is very ordinary, there be but one general perſon with a part of an Army, and in an Encounter he is kill'd, the Colonels under him ſtriving for the Command in chief, make themſelves a prey to the enemy, which fell out but a very few years ago to the <hi>Danes,</hi> when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately fought againſt the <hi>Swedes</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Rugen.</hi> Next, ſuppoſe a ſtrong party of Foot and Horſe commanded by a Colonel, who hath under him but one Lieutenant-Colonel, and one Major, ſeveral Ritmaſters, and Foot-Captains, the three Field-officers are kill'd, the queſtion is, Whether the chief command belongs to the eldeſt Ritmaſter, or the eldeſt Captain, or to him of theſe two, who can ſhew the eldeſt Commiſſion in that ſame ſervice. If the firſt of theſe Queſtions be well and judiciouſly handled and diſcuſs'd, there will need but a few words to be ſpoken to the reſt.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Queſtion being, which of the two Officers of Horſe and Foot of equal quality ſhall have the command? there be ſome who take a broad axe to it, and by an equal diviſion would ſatisfie both parties, and ſay, that in the Fields the Officer of Horſe, and in Towns, Caſtles, Garriſons, and fortified places, the Officer of Foot ſhould have the prime command; this Arbitration would ſeem to give pretty good ſatisfaction to peaceable men, but the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Commanders of Horſe challenges the Superiority in all places; nor do I think the Officers of Foot ſhould be ſo modeſt as to give it them in any place without the expreſs command of the Prince, or his General. Aſſuredly this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority cannot in reaſon be challenged by either Foot or Horſe, unleſs they conceive their imployment is either more neceſſary, more to be truſted to, or more honourable than the other. We ſhall then get ſome light to decide the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, when we have examined whether the Cavalry or Infantry of an Army be moſt neceſſary, or moſt truſted to, and moſt honourable, or all three. And firſt as to the neceſſity, reaſon, and if I have any right reaſon, common ſenſe
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:97406:131"/> will evince that Horſes are not abſolutely neceſſary in the managing a War, but as they ſay, <hi>ad bene eſſe,</hi> only needful they are for the better managing the War, or to ſay better, they are uſeful and convenient, but the Foot are purely and abſolutely neceſſary, as without which no War ever was, nor no War ever can be managed. Conſider that the Impugnation and defence of Towns, Forts and Caſtles is one of the moſt important and moſt neceſſary points of War, or of the whole Military Art, yet theſe have been, may be, and for moſt part are maintained and defended, and aſſaulted and taken by the Foot only, without the help of Horſemen, and I think they are not Paradoxical, who ſay that Horſemen are ſo far from being neceſſary, that they are not convenient within beſieged places, and without at Sieges as little, unleſs an enemy with Succours be expected. And in the field a well order'd and couragious well armed Batallion of Foot, are not ſo ſoon trode down by a Brigade of Horſe as ſome men fancy, and when their charge is ſtoutly ſtood out, I know not what the Horſe can do, but ride, I will not ſay, run away. If we look upon the practice of Nations both ancient and modern, we ſhall find all I have ſaid ſupported, and more too. And though our young Gallants will be governed by no former cuſtoms, yet I believe Truth it ſelf hath bid us follow the good old way. And therefore let us take a ſhort view how little neceſſary many Nations have thought Horſemen to be in their Wars.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Battel we read of in holy Writ was when the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> and his Confederates were beaten, and the Priſoners and Goods reſcued by <hi>Abraham,</hi> we find none of theſe nine Kings had any Horſemen; nor do I think any will fancy that <hi>Abraham</hi> mounted his three hundred and eighteen Servants on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back when he purſued <hi>Chederlaomer, Amraphel,</hi> and the other two Kings. If we had not the warrant of holy Writ for it, we ſhould not be obliged to believe that the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> would have muſter'd ſo many hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of men in ſuch ſhort and narrow ſpots of ground as that whereof they were maſters; and ſince we read not of any Horſes, we may conclude, all their Armies conſiſted of Foot. Nay more, the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were commanded not to multiply Horſes; and <hi>Solomon</hi> is taxed for prevaricating with this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as well as for his multiplying Wives and Concubines. Now if the Lord of Hoſts had thought it neceſſary that Horſemen ſhould have been in the Hoſt of his Choſen people, he would not have forbid their Kings to multiply horſes, but rather have commanded them to provide ſtore of them for managing their Wars, which they might eaſily enough have done out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them were to be bought. It ſeems then to me that neither the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> nor their neighbours, the <hi>Ammonites, Moabites,</hi> nor the Nations whom Gods people were order'd to extirpate, thought Horſemen neceſſary at all.</p>
                     <p>And if we peruſe other Hiſtories, we ſhall find that many ancient people of the world had many bloody Engagements without the help of Horſes. And not to go ſo far back, it is not yet above a hundred and ſixty years ſince the <hi>Switzers</hi> with their Foot-Batallions without the help of one Horſeman, durſt fight againſt Armies compoſed of numerous Foot, Horſe, and Artillery, witneſs their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at <hi>Novara</hi> over the <hi>French</hi> Army, wherein they deſtroyed all the <hi>French</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, took all their Cannon, and chac'd away all their Cavalry. And <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt knew well what work they gave him at <hi>Martignan</hi> when he was in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at the head of two brave Armies of Foot and Horſe, one <hi>French,</hi> the other <hi>Venetians,</hi> as you have it related in the ſeventh Chapter of the <hi>Modern Art of War.</hi> The <hi>Americans</hi> following the light and law of Nature, made fierce Wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves before <hi>Columbus</hi> diſcover'd them, without Horſe; and when they ſaw ſome of theſe Animals mounted by <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they had ſuch notions of them, as fabulous Antiquity had of the <hi>Centaurs,</hi> whom they imagin'd to be half men, half beaſt. The civiliz'd <hi>Grecians</hi> made uſe of horſes, but not as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, for many of their Battels were fought without them. And the <hi>Romans</hi> who conquer'd moſt of the then known World, made uſe but of few of them, and many times they made their Horſemen quit their horſes, and fight on foot, ſo little accounted they them to be abſolutely neceſſary; but of this more hereafter. Only obſerve, that as the <hi>Grecians</hi> had but the ſixth part or the eighth of their Armies horſe, ſo the <hi>Romans</hi> for moſt part had but the fourteenth part of their Army mounted on horſeback. And let no man ſay that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:97406:131"/> this was done for want of horſes, for ſo it continued to be when they were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of all <hi>Italy, Spain, France,</hi> much of <hi>Africk,</hi> and a good part of <hi>Greece.</hi> How little <hi>James</hi> the Fifth of <hi>Scotland</hi> conceived Horſemen to be neceſſary in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, you may ſee in an Act of his Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1640, two years before his death, wherein he ordains that if any come to the place of Randezvouz on Horſeback, he ſhall ſend back his horſe with a Foot-boy, except Earls, Lords, and Barons, and the reaſon he gives, is becauſe theſe Horſes deſtroy poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Corn and Meadows, and are not neceſſary in his Hoſts, where all men muſt fight on foot.</p>
                     <p>In my Diſcourſes of the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Art of VVar; I ſpoke not of theſe queſtions mentioned here: for as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being asked why their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver <hi>Licurgus</hi> made no Law againſt Thieves? anſwered, becauſe no ſuch crime as Theft was heard of among them; ſo I ſay, neither <hi>Grecian</hi> nor <hi>Roman</hi> knew any thing of thoſe queſtions mentioned in theſe Papers. And ſince by what is ſaid, VVars have been, and may be managed (though not ſo well) without Horſe, but not at all without Foot, I conclude the laſt abſolutely neceſſary, but not the firſt; what reaſon then that a Foot-Officer that is abſolutely neceſſary, ſhould be commanded by an Officer of Horſe, without whom the War in caſe of neceſſity may be managed?</p>
                     <p>Next, we are to conſider whether the Horſe or Foot is moſt truſted, and which of the two Services is moſt honourable, and theſe I ſhall ſpeak of not ſeverally, but conjunctly, for I ſuppoſe it will not be denied that the greater the truſt be, the greater is the honour; for if the King intruſt a Citizen or a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who is neither Lord, Knight, nor Gentleman, to be a Privy Councellor, certainly that Citizen by that great truſt is not only honourable, but right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and that title belongs to him as well as to a Lord. We are here to conſider that an Army compoſed of Horſe and Foot, repreſents a man, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry his body, the Cavalry his ſides, aſſuredly the intrinſick parts of a man that are contained within his breaſt and belly, are more honourable than the extrinſecal ones, which be his ſides, legs, and arms; and hence it is that they get the name of noble and vital parts, and if this compariſon hold, as I hope it will, then it is as extravagant a deſire of an Officer of Horſe to be admitted to command over an Officer of Foot as for the rib of a mans ſide to ſeek power over the heart, liver, or lungs of the ſame man. Or if you pleaſe, an Army is like to a bird or fowl, the Infantry is the body of the bird, and the Cavalry the two wings; the ſides of a man may be pitifully wounded, and the wings of a bird broken, and yet the bodies of both man and bird preſerved; and even ſo, as long as the Infantry keeps the Field, Victory is there, though both the ſides or wings of the Horſe be broken and fled. And ſo it fell out at the Battel of <hi>Oxenfield</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the year 1638.</p>
                     <p>With the Infantry the Artillery both ancient and modern, was, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly intruſted with the Infantry, the Magazines of Arms, Proviſions, Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, Ammunition and Money is intruſted; with the Infantry are intruſted the Caſtles, Forts, Ports, Havens and Strengths of the Land, and the Prince his Treaſure, and theſe make the vitals, not only of an Army, but of a State. In fortified Camps not only all theſe, but even the Cavalry it ſelf are intruſted to the Infantry, who are to maintain and defend the Ramparts, Baſtions, and whole Circumvallation of the Camp. With the Infantry the Prince who manageth the War, or his General, or both conſtantly intruſt themſelves, and either the one or other is the head of the Army: Now, as I ſaid before, where the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt truſt is, there is the greateſt honour; and conſequently the Infantry are more honourable than the Cavalry. Theſe things were well enough known to the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians;</hi> he that commanded the whole <hi>Phalanx,</hi> that is the whole Army, ſtayed with the heavy armed Foot, ſo did all the Artillery and Ammunition of the Army. And certainly they had Detachments, as well as we have; and the <hi>Suntagmatarch</hi> of a Foot-<hi>Phalanx</hi> had under his command two hundred and fifty ſix men, with Colours and ſuitable Officers; how would the merry <hi>Greeks</hi> have laughed, if this <hi>Suntagmatarch,</hi> whom our Captains ſixty years ago in many places, (when Companies were three hundred ſtrong) did repreſent, had been required to ſubmit himſelf to the command of an <hi>Elarchos,</hi> who was Captain of ſixty four Horſe, and repreſented our Ritmaſters now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days; for ſometimes the <hi>Grecian</hi> Troop of Horſe was one hundred.</p>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:97406:132"/>
                     <p>In the <hi>Roman</hi> Art of War, a Legion was commanded by Tribunes by turns, or as we call it from the <hi>French,</hi> by <hi>toures;</hi> he whoſe ſix month it was to command, had ordinarily four thouſand two hundred, ſometimes five thouſand, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſix thouſand Foot under his command; the Horſe ordained to attend this Legion were but adjectitious, and were ſeldom above three hundred, ſometimes not ſo many. The denomination of any Officer is <hi>à majori parte,</hi> from the greater part, and therefore the Tribune was a Colonel of Foot, and yet commanded theſe three hundred Horſe as abſolutely as he did any Centuriate in the Legion. Hence it is that with reaſon I aver that in the <hi>Roman</hi> Diſcipline the Horſe were conſtantly commanded by Officers of Foot; and peruſe all the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories you ſhall not find that ever any Officer of Horſe pretended to the command of any of the Foot. With the <hi>Roman</hi> Infantry were intruſted their Baliſts, Catupults, their Battering Rams, their Ambulatory Towns, their Bridges, and all the Materials whereof theſe were compoſed. Now theſe were the Artillery of the Ancients: with the <hi>Roman</hi> Infantry were intruſted the Treaſurer and Treaſure of the Army, all Proviſions for Man and Horſe, their Altars and places of Devotion; and though the Troops of Horſe had their petty Standards and <hi>Vexilla,</hi> yet the Eagle which was mounted on a long Pole, and was the great Enſign of the Legion, was conſtantly intruſted to the keeping of the firſt Centurion, who was a Foot-officer. With the Foot the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul march'd, lodg'd, and fought. All theſe being intruſted to the <hi>Roman</hi> Foot, and not to the Horſe, ſhews that theſe Conquerours of the World eſteemed the Foot-ſervice more honourable than that of Horſe; for ſtill I ſay, the more truſt the more honour. It is true, the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſemen were all elected of Gentlemen, (for ſo I interpret the <hi>Equeſtris Ordo</hi>) and therefore I doubt not but they had a Precedency at door and Table before the Legionary Soldiers, who were all levied out of the Commons; but that gave them no Superiority or command over the Foot, which is the thing now pretended to. Nor will the <hi>Roman</hi> Diſcipline, which order'd the Horſe to ride the Rounds about the Guards of Foot, as you have it in the twenty ſecond Chapter of the <hi>Roman</hi> Art of War, entitle theſe Horſemen to any Superiority or command over theſe Guards of Foot; no more than a Gentleman who is ſent to go a Round with Muſqueteers to attend him, will evince that he hath the command of theſe Guards or any Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel of them, both the Ancient and Modern Rounds being only obliged to give an account to thoſe who ſent them, in what poſture they found the Guards and Centinels; yea, theſe four <hi>Roman</hi> Horſemen who were to ride the Rounds, were commanded to lye at the door of the Hut or Tent of a Centurion of Foot, which I think denoted their ſubjection to him.</p>
                     <p>Thus I think it is clear, that with theſe ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> to whoſe arms and diſcipline of War moſt of the world paid homage, the Foot-ſervice was more honourable than that on Horſeback. To confirm this, I hope it will be granted me, that where the greateſt danger is, there is to be expected the greateſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Now very often the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls where they ſaw the Enemy prevail in Battel, they called the Cavalry or a part of it thither, but miſtake it not, it was not to fight on horſeback, but to make them alight from their Horſes, and fight on foot with the Legionaries, which encouraged the Foot when they ſaw the Horſe could not ride from them. And therefore ſince the danger was greater to fight on foot than on horſeback, the <hi>Romans</hi> thought fighting on foot more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable than fighting on horſeback, and conſequently the Foot-ſervice more honourable than that of Horſemen. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> the greateſt Captain that ever was, practiſed this in the greateſt Battel he ever fought, which was againſt the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> now called <hi>Switzers.</hi> To ſhew good example he alighted firſt from his horſe, and then cauſed all his Cavalry to alight, and as himſelf tells us, cauſed all the horſes to be driven away a great way from that place of Battel. And ſo did ſeveral of the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls before him. And I think you need not doubt but the horſemen being on foot were marſhal'd by the Tribune as the Foot were, and ſo the Decurions who were Captains of horſe, received their orders from the Centurions, each whereof commanded ſixty Footmen, whereas the Decurion had but the command of thirty. So here we ſee Officers of Horſe commanded by Officers of Foot, but never the contrary. I find <hi>Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Saul</hi> before him, and moſt of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> after him, except ſome who fought on Chariots to their ſmall advantage, but none fought on horſeback; I believe <hi>Abſalom</hi> fought on foot, though after his rebellious Army was routed, he mounted on a Mule to carry him away with more haſte than good ſpeed. Many Kings in the Modern Wars ſince Gunpowder made a noiſe, have fought on foot; <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth of <hi>England</hi> fought nine Battels on foot, our Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> did ſo frequently. And if King <hi>James</hi> the fourth was kill'd at <hi>Flowdon,</hi> he was ſlain fighting on foot, and all theſe were Princes who trac'd the path of honour, and ſtudied both to ſhew their own valour, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their enemies, which they conceived they did more properly on foot than on horſeback.</p>
                     <p>Since the beſt govern'd Kingdoms and States both ancient and modern have given the honour to the Foot and not the Horſe, by intruſting them with their chief ſtrength, their Treaſure, their Artillery, Proviſions, Ammunitions, Towns, Caſtles, and fortified places, I cannot enough admire what new light the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of Horſe of our time have got, that can move them to demand a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over the Officers of Foot, of equal quality with themſelves. If they ſay becauſe they can be ſooner at an enemy than the Foot can, it will be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they can alſo ride ſooner from an enemy than the Foot can go. I ſhall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily grant that three or fourſcore years ago, the Curiaſſiers of <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Gens d'Armes</hi> of <hi>France</hi> being all Gentlemen might very well have Precedency at door or board of the Foot-Soldiers, but could not thereby pretend to any Superiority or command over them. But now the caſe is altered, for in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Denmark, Sweden,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and here with us in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> for moſt part the horſemen are levied out of the Plebeians as well as the Foot. And I believe the <hi>Gens d'Armes</hi> of <hi>France</hi> are much fallen from their Primitive Inſtitution, moſt of their Cavalry being compoſed of the Vulgar, except the Ban and Arreerban, which conſiſts of Gentlemen that have Eſtates in lands, who by the tenure of their Lands and Inheritance are bound to ſerve the King on horſeback, ſo many days within, and ſo many days without the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                     <p>But before I go further I conceive my ſelf obliged to anticipate an objection, which both may, and will be made by the great Champions of the Cavalry, and it is this, that many, at leaſt ſome States and Kingdoms have been, and ſome at this day are, whoſe ſtrength conſiſted, and conſiſts in Horſe, and not in Foot. But though I grant them all they ſeek, which yet I will not do, they gain nothing unleſs they make it appear that a War can and may be managed with horſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and not with any Foot, which they will never be able to do. Firſt, they ſay that in the days of <hi>Yore,</hi> the greateſt ſtrength of <hi>France</hi> conſiſted in Horſe; that Kingdom indeed gloried much in a noble and couragious Cavalry, but exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their ſtories, you will find that the moſt glorious of their Kings, <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, his Father <hi>Pepin,</hi> and his Father <hi>Charles Martel,</hi> their famous atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>France, Saxony, Germany, Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> were done with Foot as well as with horſe; many of their Kings fought on foot, and <hi>Orlando</hi> Nephew to <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, when he had fought well on foot died, of thirſt and wounds. Thoſe of their Kings who made their Cavalry their greateſt ſtrength in the field, bought it dear when they were ſo often worſted by the <hi>Spaniards, Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings,</hi> but moſt of all by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whoſe greateſt ſtrength conſiſted in Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. This made the <hi>French</hi> Kings beg and hire Foot from <hi>Scotland, Germany,</hi> and moſtly from the <hi>Switzers.</hi> Theſe laſt being diſcontented with <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, made all <hi>France</hi> tremble, when with a numerous Army (in which not one Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was to be ſeen) they were like to fall like an Inundation on that Kingdom, and were come the length of <hi>Dijon</hi> in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and had reach'd <hi>Paris</hi> without ſtroke of Sword, if the Duke <hi>de Tremouille</hi> had not amus'd them with a Treaty, in which he was forc'd to grant them all they deſir'd, and for performance gave them what Hoſtages they required. <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt perceiving the error of ſome of his Predeceſſors, in truſting too much to Horſes, ordered ſeven Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Foot, all <hi>French</hi> to be levied, enrolled, and paid each conſiſting of ſeven thouſand men, to ſtand perpetually in time of Peace and Wars, and theſe he call'd, and I think very deſervedly, the ſinews and nerves of <hi>France.</hi>

                     <p>Next they will object, that the <hi>Mamaluks</hi> kept their Empire in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> above two hundred years with Horſe, and without Foot. This is a horrible miſtake, for their Towns and Forts were taken by Foot, and defended by Foot without Horſe. They alſo loſt their Empire by putting too much truſt in their Horſe, for the Great <hi>Turk Selim</hi> with his Foot and Cannon beat and kill'd <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Gaurus</hi> in the Field, and <hi>Tomomby</hi> at <hi>Cairo,</hi> and ſo put an end to that Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They will inſtance the <hi>Perſian,</hi> who defends his Kingdom without Foot, only with Cavalry; but this is a miſtake, for their Towns are defended with Foot, and <hi>Iſmael</hi> in the <hi>Calderan</hi> Plains payed dear for truſting ſo much to his Horſe, when he was chac'd away by <hi>Selines</hi> Foot and Artillery. Since that time the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> have endeavour'd, but without ſucceſs, to get <hi>European</hi> Officers to Train their Foot, and order their Artillery; for my part I can as ſoon dream that the <hi>Perſian</hi> Squadrons of Horſe put themſelves in Enchanted Caſtles, as that they defended their Towns againſt Sieges and Aſſaults of the <hi>Turks</hi> with Horſe and no Foot.

                     <p>The <hi>Hungarians</hi> will come next in play, but they never managed any of their Wars without Foot, though they pay'd as dearly for truſting too much to their Caval<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It will be in vain to bring <hi>Pole</hi> on the ſtage, for peruſe the Hiſtories of that Nation, you will find none of their Wars to have been made either offenſively, or defenſively without Foot; to imagin that the <hi>Polonians</hi> conquer'd the half of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> from the Knights of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order, and took in ſo many well wall'd Towns without Foot againſt that warlike fraternity, is a meer ſpeculation. Nor have they bought the great truſt they repoſe in a numerous and valiant Cavalry at a cheap rate. In the year 1621 <hi>Pole</hi> was ſav'd almoſt by a miracle, for aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prince <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> would not have defended his Fathers Kingdom, though he had eighty thouſand Horſe, and ſome thouſands of Foot with him, againſt <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Oſman,</hi> who invaded it with three hundred thouſand <hi>Turks,</hi> the great Body and ſtrength whereof conſiſted in the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who mutinying againſt the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> forc'd him back to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> But what a risk did <hi>Pole</hi> run lately in the years 1655, and 1656, and 1657, where <hi>Charles Guſtavus</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came that Kingdom with an Army of twenty thouſand men, moſt of them Foot; and obſerve what a well train'd and order'd Infantry can do, <hi>Anno</hi> 1656, when the rebellious <hi>Polonians</hi> had returned to their duty, and that their King <hi>John Caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If all this be true that I have ſaid, as I believe it is, then I may conclude, that the Foot-ſervice is more neceſſary, more honourable, and of greater truſt than the Horſe one. Since I believe I have made it appear that a War in all its parts, points and dimenſions may be managed with Foot, without any Horſe, (though I confeſs not ſo well) but that it can be ſo without Foot, is a pure Speculation; why ſhould then Officers of Horſe be ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening as to pretend to a Superiority over Commanders of Foot of equal quality with themſelves, ſince they themſelves may with leſs hurt and leſs incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience be ſpared out of an Army, than thoſe of the Infantry? Nor do I ſee with what right an Officer of Horſe can pretend to the command of an Officer of Dragoons of the like quality, for that Dragoons are reckon'd to belong to the Cavalry, though their ſervice be on foot, will only entitle the General or Lieutenant-General, or Major General of the Horſe to command over them, but not a Ritmaſter to give Orders to a Captain of Dragoons, unleſs he can ſhew an elder Patent. Yet when I ſerv'd in <hi>Germany,</hi> this Emperours Father or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd a Colonel-General over all his Dragoons, but whether he was Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Commander in chief of the Horſe, I cannot ſo well tell. And if
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:97406:133"/> in the field the Commanders of Horſe ought not to aſſume this Superiority, much leſs ought they to do it in Garriſons, Towns, Caſtles, or yet in Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Villages, for theſe do reſemble fortified places. On the other hand, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the opinion of ſome, who underſtand well enough, I think it would be of very hard digeſtion for an Officer of Horſe, though within a Fort or walled Town to receive Orders from a Foot-officer of a lower quality than himſelf. Suppoſe a Colonel of Horſe to be under the command of a Lieutenant-Colonel of Foot, or a Major of Horſe under a Captain of Foot. For though there be no Subordination between them, yet when an Officer of a higher qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is commanded by one of an inferior degree, it brings ſuperior charges in diſreſpect and diſeſteem, which would carefully be avoided. <hi>Koningſmark</hi> who became a famous General in the <hi>German</hi> War, when he was Colonel of Horſe, came to lye with ſome of his Troops in <hi>Oſnabrug,</hi> where Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Lumſdaine</hi> commanded in abſence of his Brother Sir <hi>James, Koningſmark</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to that Command, proteſting that if Sir <hi>James</hi> who was a Colonel, had been there, he would willingly have ſubmitted to his Command, but that either him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or any other Colonel ſhould receive Orders from a Lieutenant-Colonel, was a thing he neither could nor would underſtand: A temperament was found out by thoſe who mediated between them, and the expedient was, that the Lieutenant-Colonel ſhould keep the Keys, and exerciſe all other functions of a Governour, except the giving the Word, which the Colonel of Horſe ſhould give week about; this ſav'd the Lieutenant-Colonels intereſt, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels reputation. The Great <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi> order'd that where two or more Colonels of Horſe or Foot were in the Field or Quarter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without any General Officer to command above them, the Colonel who had the eldeſt Commiſſion, ſhould command in chief, whether he ſerv'd to Horſe or to Foot, and ſo it was to be underſtood of all other Officers under a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. And whereas it might fall out that many ſeveral Colonels might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Patents all in one day, or that otherwiſe their antiquity might be debateable, in that caſe it was order'd that they ſhould caſt lots, which is an excellent way, for the wiſeſt of men hath le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t it on record in the beſt of Books, That the lot cauſeth contention to ceaſe, and parteth between the mighty. Now why ſhould any Soldier, or why ſhould any General, nay, why ſhould any Prince be aſhamed to follow the rule or example of ſo famous a King, or ſo renowned a Captain as Great <hi>Guſtavus</hi> was known to have been.</p>
                     <p>Having ſpoken ſo much to the firſt queſtion, I ſuppoſe I need ſpeak but little to the ſecond, which, you may remember, I ſubdivided into two parts, the firſt was, Whether an Officer of Horſe may command an Officer of Foot; though of a ſuperiour quality, as ſuppoſe a Lieutenant of Horſe command a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Foot, a Quartermaſter of a Troop of Horſe to command a Lieutenant of Foot, a Captain of Horſe to command a Major of Foot, and that only by virtue of their ſerving on horſeback: But if it be true, what I have aſſerted, and endeavoured to prove<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that no Officers, (what ever their ſervice be) Horſe or Foot, of equal quality can with reaſon pretend to the command of one another; then it will aſſuredly follow, that an Inferour can far leſs pretend to any ſuch authority over a Superiour. But there ſeems to be a greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the ſecond queſtion, which is, Whether an Officer of a King, Prince, or Generals Guards, either of Horſe or Foot, ought to command over not only his equals in another Regiment or Troop, but even over thoſe, who in quality are above him: As whether a Lieutenant of theſe Guards may not, or ſhould not command over any Captain of another Regiment, or a Captain of thoſe Guards over any Major of the Army. And truly, as the queſtion is ſtated, and ſo ordinarily it is ſtated, I muſt anſwer negatively: And yet ſhall go as great a length, with theſe Officers of Guards, as I conceive true Military Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and method of War will permit me, and perhaps further. I ſay then, that a Generals guard either of Horſe or Foot, much more that of a King, or abſolute Prince, in a march ſhould conſtantly have the Vaunt of all other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, Companies, or Troops of the Army, both for their honour and that they may be in time at the Head quarter to officiate, and do duty: I ſay next, that all Officers belonging to theſe guards have the priority and precedency, not only of Door and Table, but even in all Courts and Councils of War, before
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:97406:134"/> any other Officers in the Army of their own rank and quality; but not of others of a higher charge; nay more, though it be a received maxim both in the Civil and Military Law, that <hi>Par in parem non habet poteſtatem,</hi> One equal hath no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over his equal; yet I hold when Officers of guards are by ſome emergency or other, or by command, to march, or quarter with Officers of other Regiments of equal quality; the Officer of the guards ſhould have the command over the other. Suppoſe theſe be either Captains, Lieutenauts, Majors, Lieutenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, or Colonels, further than this I cannot go, till I get more light, than the high demands of ſome hath yet afforded me. Nor can I fancy any reaſon for this pretence of ſuperiority, but the will and pleaſure of the Prince, his General or his Privy Council, and indeed that muſt neither be contradicted nor controul'd; yet I conceive, the inconveniences of ſuch an unuſual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, may be repreſented to the Prince, his General and his Council; and I ſuppoſe they will be loth to give, or to leave any occaſions of heart burnings, animoſities, debates, or diſcontents. How ſtrange and odd will it be to ſee a young and raw Captain of the guards, who by the favour of powerful friends hath come to that charge, to command over a grave and experienced Major? it is the way to make Diſcipline of War contemptible to ſome, and ridiculous to others. I remember that in <hi>Germany</hi> one of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ad the chief command of a little Army, and over all the Garriſons of that Country, which were not few; a ſtrong party of that Army of Horſe and Foot was drawn out to attack a little Town ſtrongly barricado'd, by the enemies; five hundred commanded Foot were to fall on firſt, under the conduct of a Lieutenant Colonel: He who was Lieutenant Colonel of the Lieutenant Generals Regiment, which had the name of Guards, pretended to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and debated it ſtrongly; there was an elder Lieutenant Colonel than he, of another Regiment, who ſtiffly refuſed to yield to the Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel of the Guards, pretending to the command, becauſe he had been a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Colonel in the <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſervice long before the other; the Lieutenant General is conſulted, who preſently order'd them to caſt the Dice for it, his own Lieutenant Colonel by lot gained the honour, but loſt his life by the bargain: You ſee how this Lieutenant General was loth to give occaſion of diſcontent, by preferring an Officer of the Guards to another of that ſame qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but of an elder ſtanding; and yet, if I had been worthy to have been Arbitrator, I had awarded the command to the Lieutenant Colonel of the Guards: Thus far have I hazarded to publiſh my opinion of this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted point; and as every thing that men write, muſt be ſubject to the variable judgments of ſeveral Readers, ſo I profeſs I ſhall be willing to alter my opinion when the reaſons of others ſhall even but probably convince me to have been in an error. I am ſure to maintain either the one or the other, will tranſgreſs nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Act or Statute of either Church or State. Ordinances of War, even of the greateſt of men, are not irrevocable as the Decrees of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> were ſaid to be. But notwithſtanding any reaſon can be given for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of what I have ſaid in avoiding this queſtion, this great King of <hi>France</hi> gives a Superiority of ſome Officers over others of that ſame degree, and not only to thoſe of his own Guards (which are very many) and thoſe of the Queen, the <hi>Dolphine,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur</hi> his Brother, which I look upon as tolerable; but he gives the command to <hi>French</hi> Officers over ſtrangers of a higher quality, in ſo much that in one Chapter of his Ordinances, he orders Lieutenant-Colonels who are ſtrangers, to be commanded (if I remember right) by a <hi>French</hi> Enſign. If private men might examine the Directions of mighty Monarchs, I ſhould think this were enough to encourage all ſtrangers to offer their ſervice to the Capital Enemies of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty.</p>

                  <p>OUR Modern forces being levied, muſter'd, arm'd, well exercis'd, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin'd, paid and provianted, and moulded in Troops, Companies and Regiments, call now for General Officers, that theſe Independent Bodies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have ſpoken may be caſt in the ſhape of an Army. Theſe ſhall not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, for it is but too ordinary to have more General Officers in an Army than there are Colonels in it, and yet a great deal of more Colonels than are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,<note place="margin">Many Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons in an Army.</note> if you conſider the weakneſs of their Regiments. And truly I think it is an inſupportable abuſe and vanity, that no ſooner is a Lieutenant or Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſent with a part of the Army on ſome exploit, which may require ſome conſiderable time, or that upon ſome other occaſion, either for a ſpeedy march, the accommodation of the Army, or the eaſe of the Country, every one who commands apart one wing or Tertia of that Army, in a very ſhort time makes up a compleat General ſtaff. Of the General of the Artillery, Commiſſaries, Muſter-maſters, and Proviant-maſters General, and of the Auditor and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt-marſhal General, I have ſpoke in their proper places, and ſo I ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after of the Quarter-maſter, Scout-maſter, and Waggon-maſter General, and now I am to give you a brief deſcription of theſe General Officers mention'd in the Title of this Chapter.</p>

                     </note> marſhals the Field, and is called in <hi>French, Marſhal de Camp,</hi> and ſo the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive inſtitution of the Office was, and ſo it continued, till within theſe fifty years; for the preſent in <hi>Germany, Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> thoſe who command Armies Royal conſiſting of Cavalry, Infantry, and Artillery, are qualified by the Titles of <hi>Felt-marſhals,</hi> and have an equivalent authority to the ancient Marſhals of <hi>France</hi> far above that of <hi>Marſhals de Camp;</hi> and thoſe Felt-marſhals have under them Lieutenant-Generals of the whole Army, Generals and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-Generals of Horſe and Foot, and theſe laſt are now the Marſhals of the Field, for they draw up the ſeveral Regiments and Brigades of both in order of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. So upon the matter a Felt-marſhal is now General or Commander in chief of the Army, ſo were <hi>Barrier, Torſtenſone,</hi> and <hi>Wrangel,</hi> ſucceſſively one after another, in the long <hi>German</hi> War, under <hi>Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden.</hi> Theſe Felt marſhals now have Generals and Trains of Artillery under them. A Felt-marſhals abſolute command of an Army, as I ſaid before, is of no old date, for in my time <hi>Ilo</hi> was Felt-marſhal to <hi>Wallenſtein, Guſtavus Horne</hi> to the King of <hi>Sweden, Kniphauſin</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Lunenburg;</hi> and as in proceſs of time he hath inſenſibly attain'd to a higher and more abſolute power than before, ſo the Title of Lieutenant Felt-marſhal ſignifies now more than it could be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">Lieutenant-Felt-marſhal.</note> to do at its firſt inſtitution, and the title it ſelf is not old. When the late King of <hi>Sweden</hi> invaded <hi>Pole,</hi> he gratified ſome of his ancient General Officers with this Title, and it was then and is now, where it is uſed, look'd upon as more honourable than that of Lieutenant-General, for what reaſon I cannot divine; yet it is certainly ſo, for a Lieutenant Felt-marſhal commands Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of Horſe or Foot, Count <hi>Koningſmark</hi> had commanded ſeveral Armies in chief in the long <hi>German</hi> War both prudently and ſucceſsfully under the title of Lieutenant-General, but thought himſelf honour'd ſeven years after the Peace of <hi>Munſter,</hi> with this title of Lieutenant Felt-marſhal. That muſt be moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable that a Prince fancies to be ſo, and there is good reaſon for it, becauſe he is the fountain of honour.</p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:97406:135"/>
                  <p>A Lieutenant General, (if you take the word ſtrictly) hath no command<note place="margin">Lieutenant-General of an Army.</note> when his General is preſent; I think it is a moſt proper Title for thoſe who command Armies in chief under a Monarch or free State, becauſe they are their Lieutenants in <hi>Militaribus,</hi> or if a Prince have appointed a Captain-General to command all his forces, then that Captain-General commiſſionates Lieutenant-Generals to command petty Armies under him; but when he joins his forces, the Command of the Lieutenant-General ſeems to ceaſe, becauſe he is but the Deputy of him that ſent him, and a Repreſentative is no more a Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, when he whom he repreſented is preſent. The <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls had their Lieutenant Generals, who were called Legates, who commanded Armies apart,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Roman</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates.</note> when the Conſuls thought fit, but had no command when the Conſul was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Nor doth <hi>Caeſar</hi> give thoſe Legates even in the Conſuls abſence, an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power; for ſpeaking of one of his own Legates in the <hi>French</hi> War, I believe it was <hi>Labienus,</hi> he commends him for not hazarding a Battel with the <hi>Gauls,</hi> though he ſeem'd to have the advantage, becauſe, ſaith he, a Legate hath not that power which he hath, who is <hi>Imperator</hi> or Commander in chief. One of the Dukes of <hi>Aumale</hi> commanded an Army in <hi>France</hi> againſt the Proteſtants with the Title of Lieutenant-General, but ſo ſoon as he join'd forces with <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who was Captain-General for his Brother <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, the Duke reſign'd both his Title and Office. But notwithſtanding all this, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Generals continue both in their Title and Office in their Generals pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and I have known Felt-marſhals have Lieutenant-Generals under them, who have commanded both the Horſe and Foot of their Armies, even when the Felt-marſhals were preſent; as the Earl of <hi>Bramford</hi> who was Lieutenant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to Felt-marſhal <hi>Barrier,</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> who was Lieutenant-General to Felt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marſhal <hi>Leſlie.</hi> I think the great Dukes of <hi>Muſcovia</hi> have a very commendable cuſtom to chuſe any of their Colonels, who they fancy are qualified for it to be Generals or Lieutenant-Generals of a competent number of forces fit for the expedition they are to be imployed in, and ſo ſoon as that piece of ſervice is<note place="margin">A good cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom.</note> done, the Colonel lays down his Commiſſion, and returns to his former Charge, without the leaſt thought or imagination, that he is diſparag'd thereby, the frequent practice of this cuſtom baniſhing ſuch thoughts out of all mens heads. Neither would ſuch a practice be fancyed to be a degrading of men from former honours in other places of the world, if they were but a little habituated to it. The <hi>French</hi> gives now the Title of Lieutenant-Generals very frequently, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they are independent one of another, and are the Kings Lieutenant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, which is very proper, and obey none but ſuch as he commands to give Orders to them.</p>
                  <p>A General of the Cavalry commands it under him who is Commander in<note place="margin">General of the Cavalry.</note> chief of the Army, whatever title he bear, whether General, Felt-marſhal, Lieutenant Felt-marſhal, or Lieutenant-General. He is to ſee the Troops and Regiments of Horſe kept at that ſtrength that they are appointed to be of; and if by Battel, long marches, great fatigue, or other accidents of War, the numbers of men be diminiſht, Horſes loſt, or made unſerviceable, it is his duty when they come to Quarter, to ſee the Troops made ſtrong, the Horſes put in good caſe, and the Riders well cloth'd and arm'd. In Muſters he is obliged to ſee that no Colonel or Ritmaſter wrong the Muſter-maſters, by<note place="margin">His Duties.</note> making a ſhow of borrow'd men, Horſes or Arms, whereby the Prince may be cheated in his Purſe, or diſappointed in his ſervice. He is to take care that the Cavalry be paid, and provided with Proviant and Fodderage, and good Quarter. He ſhould alſo be a perſon who underſtands ſomething of the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice, in regard that when the greateſt part of the Horſe is ſent in any Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ordinarily ſome Foot are ſent with them, and then it is the General of the Cavalries office to command both. But it is a pity that all General perſons ſhould not make it their ſtudy and their work to underſtand both the Foot and Horſe-ſervice, for I have ſeen conſiderable parties of Foot more haraſs'd and ſpoil'd in a-ſhort time under the command of an Officer of Horſe, than if they had been routed by an enemy; ſo little diſcretion ſome have to know the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a man and a Horſe. It ſeems in the <hi>Low-Country</hi> ſervice the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Horſe commanded next the General, and in his abſence over the Army, even when they had Felt-marſhals; but that cuſtom is not now in other
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:97406:135"/> places where Felt-marſhals, and Lieutenant-Felt-marſhals command the Generals of the Horſe; and it would ſeem that the Eſtates of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> have now voided the difference otherwiſe, ſince they qualified the two Commanders in chief of their Armies with the Titles of Felt-marſhals, Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> and <hi>Wurz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Lieutenant-General of the Horſe being in his Generals abſence to do the<note place="margin">Lieutenant General of the Cavalry.</note> ſame duties, he ſhould have the ſame qualifications. If the Cavalry be marſhal'd in one Body, the General is to ſtand on the right hand of it, and the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General on the left. But if the Horſe be drawn up in two wings, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral commands the right, and the Lieutenant-General commands the left wing.</p>
                  <p>A Major-General of the Cavalry is to receive the word, and all other Orders<note place="margin">Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Horſe.</note> from the Commander in chief of the Army; he is to impart them to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the Lieutenant-General of the Cavalry, and after he hath received their commands, he is to give all to the Regiment Quarter-maſters of Horſe, which they carry to the ſeveral Regiments. All complaints and differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Officers and Horſemen, or among themſelves, are firſt brought to him, which he ſhould endeavour to compoſe in an amicable way, but if he cannot,<note place="margin">Major-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of Horſe,</note> he is to proceed according to the Articles and Conſtitutions of War. He hath the inſpection of all the Guards of Horſe, and orders them, and keeps liſts of Convoys and Parties, that the ſeveral Officers and Troopers may have their turns, in which a Major-General ſhould ſhow himſelf very impartial; for very few or none there be, who will not think themſelves wrong'd in their reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">His Duties,</note> if others be prefer'd to them, where either danger may probably be look'd for, or profit expected, unleſs it can be made clear to them that it is not their turn to go on that party, or with that Convoy. It is the Major-General who marſhals the Cavalry in Battel, having firſt adviſed about the manner with the General of the Horſe, or in his abſence with the Lieutenant-General. If he be an underſtanding, active, ſtirring and vigilant perſon, a General and Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General may be laid aſide, as in many Armies over Chriſtendom they are, though not in all. This Officer the <hi>Engliſh</hi> qualifie with the Title of Commiſſary General of the Horſe.</p>
                  <p>The Duties of a Lieutenant-General, and Major-General of the Foot are the<note place="margin">General Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Foot.</note> ſame which I have told you belongs to thoſe of the Horſe, <hi>mutatis mutandis.</hi> Generals of the Foot are but rare, <hi>Banier</hi> was under <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> and <hi>Lind</hi> under <hi>Charles Guſtavus,</hi> both Kings of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and ſome of the Emperours Armies had them likewiſe. Some Lieutenant-Generals of the Infantry I have likewiſe known, but theſe are not in all Armies. But a Major-General of the Foot is thought a neceſſary Commander in all Armies, though they be never ſo weak; when any of them is wanting, or out of the way, the oldeſt Colonel of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiates for him. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> call him Serjeant Major-General of the Foot, and in ſome places he is order'd to be conſtantly Preſident of the Council of War.</p>
                  <p>The name of Adjutant-General denotes his charge and office, for he is a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<note place="margin">Adjutant-General,</note> to thoſe General Officers of whom I have ſpoken in this Chapter. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and directions he gives are not to be look'd upon as his own, but the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and therefore his perſon muſt be known to both Officers and Soldiers of the whole Army. If he have a Regiment, he may of himſelf in ſome urgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions give ſuch directions, as he thinks warrantable, and for which he knows<note place="margin">His Duties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> he can be accountable, otherwiſe, whether he be a Colonel, or not, he muſt be ſparing to give any other Orders than thoſe he hath received. He muſt be very ready, active, and ſtirring, of a quick judgment to receive, and of a ready utterance to deliver his commands. In an Army Royal when it is encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, or lyeth in Quarters, or yet when it is marching, two Adjutant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Generals, one for the Horſe, and one for the Foot, if they be men of active bodies and minds, will be ſufficient, but in a Battel they are too few. To ſupply which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and not to increaſe the number of Adjutants, the Commander in chief ought to have half a dozen of underſtanding Gentlemen well mounted, and theſe as the General rides along the Army either to marſhal or encourage it, ſhould ride with him, that the whole Army may know them as ſuch, who are to be employed to carry the General's directions, which may be very many, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:97406:136"/> as the many emergencies and changes of things may make him alter his commands; and the fitteſt perſons for that employment are ſuch Reformado's as have been Majors of Horſe and Foot formerly. I have ſeen this place of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutant-General made very contemptible by ſome Generals, who have fill'd it up<note place="margin">His Charge made deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.</note> with men, whoſe mean underſtanding, little experience, dulneſs of ſpirit, and weak intellectuals render'd them deſpicable and ridiculous to thoſe to whom they pretended to bring their Orders. He is, or ſhould be, a great helper to the Major General, whether of Horſe or Foot. But where there are two or three Major Generals of the Infantry, and perhaps as many or more of the Cavalry, I think there needs no Adjutant at all, for I know no reaſon why every Major General ſhould have an Adjutant General, nor will men be ſound to engage in a charge that is made ſo common, unleſs it be ſuch inſignificant perſons as theſe I have ſpoke of. In <hi>France</hi> this Adjutant General is called <hi>Aid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Aide de Camp,</hi> and <hi>Aide Major.</hi>
                     </note> ſome Foot Regiments the Major had his Adjutant, who was called <hi>Aide Major;</hi> and this for moſt part is one of the Lieutenants, who hath no allowance for it. In the old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſcipline of War this Adjutant was called a Corporal of the<note place="margin">Corporal of the Field.</note> Field; and there were four of them in every Army, wherein they were well known; they were mounted on good and ſwift horſes; their charge and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment was the very ſame in all things with that of our Modern Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</p>
                  <p>If I have rightly deſcribed an Adjutant General, I muſt confeſs I differ from <hi>Monſieur de Gaya,</hi> who hath lately written a ſhort Syſtem of the Art of War; in his Nineteenth Page he would have us believe that the charge of an Adjutant General, or <hi>Aide de Camp,</hi> as he calls him, is fit for a young man of quality, and in which (ſays he) it is eaſie for him to learn and make himſelf perfect. Indeed I acknowledg we are bound ſtill to be learning what is good, yet I cannot allow an Adjutant to be an Apprentice, and though it becomes him to be taught by his Betters, yet he ſhould be ſo perfect in the Military Art, that he is bound to teach others; nor can I allow him to be very young, ſince he imbraceth a charge which befits none but an experienced Soldier. But <hi>Monſieur de Gaya</hi> adds, he ſhould be wiſe, vigilant, and vigorous. I confeſs a young man may be wiſe, but I believe wiſdom here is taken for experience, whereof young men of quality may be very oft deſtitute. But <hi>Monſieur de Gaya</hi> forgot to beſtow the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Courageous upon his <hi>Aide de Camp,</hi> which if he want (being he is to carry and diſtribute his Orders in the time of hotteſt danger) I will not give a ruſh for all his wiſdom, vigilancy and vigour. He ſays alſo, that his <hi>Aide de Camp</hi> ſhould be always, (<hi>tous jours</hi>) beſides the General Officers to carry their Orders where they are neceſſary. But if he be always with them, how can he be from them when he carries their Orders where they are neceſſary? certainly he muſt be but ſometimes (<hi>Quelquefois</hi>) with them, and ſometimes from them.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all theſe General perſons mentioned, ſome would have a Quartermaſter General for the Horſe, beſides the Quartermaſter General of the Army, becauſe this laſt ſtays conſtantly at the head Quarter with the General of the Army, and the other ſhould be conſtantly with the Horſe. But I think places and offices<note place="margin">Places ſhould not be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</note> ſhould not be multiplied in Armies, and therefore the Quartermaſter of the oldeſt Regiment of Horſe may officiate in the Cavalry in the abſence of the Quartermaſter General, of whoſe office I ſhall ſpeak in my Diſcourſe of <hi>Caſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though many of theſe General Officers of whom I have ſpoken, may ſeem to be more burdenſome than uſeful, to either Prince, State, or Army, yet this preſent Emperour <hi>Leopold</hi> was glad to make uſe of them all in his late War againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> to ſatisfie that noble deſire of honour which many Princes, and other perſons of high and eminent quality had to ſerve him againſt the common Enemy of the Chriſtian name.</p>
                  <p>I have told you of all the Duties theſe General perſons are bound to pay in<note place="margin">Qualifications of all theſe General Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</note> their ſeveral charges, but I have not ſpoke of thoſe parts, vertues and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, wherewith ſome who write or ſpeak of that Subject, would have them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, they will be too tedious to rehearſe, neither can I well do it without Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologies. But I ſhall tell you that the qualifications required by ſome Authors for a Captain General, being divided between him and all the General perſons under him, may in my opinion ſerve them all ſufficiently, and what theſe are, you may read in the next enſuing Chapter.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of a Captain General, or Generaliſſimo.</head>
                  <p>IF our firſt Parents had not rebell'd againſt their Creator, their poſterity had enjoy'd an everlaſting peace, and ſo ſuch a perſon as we now ſpeak of, had been very unneceſſary. But I aſſure my ſelf never man (except <hi>Adam</hi> when he was in the ſtate of perfection) was endued with theſe gifts, wherewith ſome Notional Authors wil have a Captain General to be qualified. He muſt, ſay<note place="margin">A Notional deſcription of a Captain General.</note> they, be pious towards God, juſt towards man, and loyal to his Maſter. He muſt be very affable, very wiſe, of a ſudden and quick apprehenſion, of a ſolid judgment, and happy memory. He muſt be very ſevere in his command, and yet very merciful. He muſt be liberal, and free from all manner of Avarice, painful, magnanimous, and couragious, and in one word, endued with all the Moral Vertues. He ought to be an old Practitioner in the Military Art, and well experimented in all its parts and duties. Perhaps you may think this enough, but <hi>Polybius</hi> in his Ninth Book requires more, for he will have his General to be both an Aſtrologer, and a Geometer. If you will tell me where, or in what region of the habitable world, all theſe qualifications ſhall be found in one perſon? <hi>Eris mihi magnus Apollo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That he who is intruſted with the ſupreme Command of Royal Armies, one or more, and with the whole Militia of a State, ſhould be an accompliſht per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,<note place="margin">The charge of a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſimo is of the higheſt nature.</note> and if it be poſſible, ſuch a one, as we have deſcrib'd, will not be readily denied, ſince it is a Command of the higheſt nature, the greateſt honour, and deepeſt conſequence that can be confer'd on any ſingle perſon of what quality <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r degree ſoever, for he is intruſted not only with the lives of thoſe that are in Arms under his Command, but with the defence of the whole Country, Towns, Forts, and Caſtles, with the honour, welfare, and ſtanding of the Prince and State, and with the lives and properties of all their Subjects. The loſs of his Army, or Armies by his negligence, inadvertency, raſhneſs or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardice, may occaſion the loſs of all theſe, or make them run a very great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard by his indiſcretion, much more by his treachery; he may in one moment of time loſe the lives and liberties of many thouſands, make numbers of women widows, children fatherleſs, and fathers childleſs, he may loſe the honour and beauty of a whole Province, yea of a whole Kingdom, all which he was bound by his office and charge to preſerve.</p>
                  <p>The conſideration of theſe things mov'd moſt of the ancient Kings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,<note place="margin">A Prince to manage his Wars in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> and thoſe of latter times likewiſe to manage their Wars, and lead their Armies in perſon. Thoſe who laid the foundation of the firſt four Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies did ſo, as in the <hi>Aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rian, Nimrod, Belus, Ninus</hi> and <hi>Semiramis,</hi> and when their poſterity did it not, their Empire was in the wain, and ended with <hi>Sarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napalus,</hi> who hid himſelf from the ſight of men among his women. <hi>Cyrus</hi> led his Armies himſelf, ſo did ſome of his Succeſſors, but when others of them ſtaid at home, and ſent their Lieutenants abroad, the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd, and became a prey to the Great <hi>Alexander,</hi> who manag'd his Wars in perſon, and ſo did thoſe great Captains of his, who cut out Kingdoms to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of their Maſters Conqueſts; but their Succeſſors loſt them by ſitting idle at home, and employing their Generals abroad. Many <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours after <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> went to their Wars in perſon, whereby they preſerv'd their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Dignity; but when others imployed their Lieutenants (though many of theſe were excellent men, and often victorious) the Empire was torn in pieces. The Kings of <hi>Leon, Navarr, Caſtile, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> after the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Monarchy in <hi>Spain,</hi> went to the field in perſon, and recover'd<note place="margin">Many Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to prove it.</note> thoſe Kingdoms out of the hands of the <hi>Saracens.</hi> When the Kings of <hi>France</hi> of the <hi>Merovingian</hi> and <hi>Carolomannian</hi> race kept within their Palaces, and ſuffer'd
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:97406:137"/> the Majors thereof to govern their Armies, they loſt their Kingdoms and Crowns. Our Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> uſed moſtly to manage their Wars themſelves; the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth led his greateſt Armies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and for moſt part was always victorious, for his loſs at <hi>Algiers</hi> occaſion'd by the viſible hand of Heaven; and his forced Retreats from <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> and the Siege of <hi>Metz,</hi> were but ſmall blemiſhes in the beautiful and fair Map of his victorious raign. But ſince his time his Succeſſors the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> have ſate at home and entruſted their Armies to their Generals, and we ſee that their wide and far ſtretcht Monarchy has been ſince that Emperours time in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant decadency. All the Kings and Emperours of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> race went in perſon to the Wars, till <hi>Selimus</hi> the ſecond changed that cuſtom, and ſince that time none of them have done actions by their Baſhas comparable to thoſe of their Anceſtors. In our own days the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second intruſted the managing his War againſt <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> to his Generals, <hi>Wallenſtein, Tily,</hi> and <hi>Pappenheim,</hi> all brave and great Captains, yet that Martial King being in perſon on the head of his Armies, prevailed over them all.</p>
                  <p>We may perceive the great odds of managing a War by a Prince in his own perſon, and by his Captain General by taking a view of the actions of two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, both of them excellent Princes, theſe were the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the<note place="margin">Actions of two Brothers compar'd.</note> Fifth (of whom I but juſt now ſpoke) and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Firſt, King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Hungaria</hi> and <hi>Bohemia.</hi> The firſt, (as I have already ſaid) led his moſt conſiderable Armies himſelf; the ſecond ſtaid conſtantly at home, and ſent his Captain Generals to manage his Wars of greateſt importance; mark the iſſue, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> loſt three Royal Armies, each of them compoſed of a well appointed Cavalry, Infantry, and Train of Artillery: one of them at <hi>Eſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburg;</hi> all three were wofully and ſhamefully loſt without fighting. And if any think that the misfortune of all the three, or any one of them could not have been prevented by the Princes own preſence, I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that undoubtedly it had, and my reaſon is this, becauſe that which loſt them all, was the irreſolution of the Generals, who durſt neither fight, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in time, as being ſhie and wary to hazard that which was not their ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> whereas <hi>Ferdinand</hi> (if he had been preſent) would quickly have reſolv'd either on the one or the other, and conſequently would have either retir'd in time and ſav'd all his three Armies, or have fought, and by that means been victorious, or would have been beaten with more glory to himſelf, and miſchief to his inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent enemy. And this is more particularly clear in that Army commanded by <hi>Rocandolf,</hi> who after multitudes of Infidels were already arrived for the relief of the beſieged Queen and City of <hi>Buda,</hi> and that <hi>Soliman</hi> himſelf by ſpeedy marches was haſtning thither, could not be mov'd or perſwaded by any intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or remonſtrances of the principal Commanders of his army to raiſe the Siege, vowing and proteſting that he neither could nor would do it, without an expreſs warrant from his Maſter King <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> but before that could come, he and his misfortunate Army were both irrecoverably ruin'd. The ſad Hiſtory of all theſe three Armies, you may read at length in <hi>Paolo Giovio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Be pleaſed to take another inſtance of a later date: In the year 1657, <hi>Charles Guſtavus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi> invaded the Dutchy of <hi>Holſtein</hi> with a very inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able army, his Horſemen and his Soldiers were almoſt naked, and all beaten<note place="margin">Actions of two Kings compar'd.</note> with a long march from <hi>Pole;</hi> nor was it ſo ſtrong as eleven thouſand of all. <hi>Frederick</hi> the third King of <hi>Denmark</hi> intruſts a well appointed army of ſixteen thouſand Horſe and Foot to a Feltmarſhal, and ſtays at <hi>Cop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nhagen</hi> himſelf, by the perſwaſions of his Privy Council. The <hi>Swede</hi> being in perſon on the head of his haraſs'd army prevail'd every where, ruined the <hi>Daniſh</hi> army without one blow, and beſieged the reliques of it in <hi>Frederichſode,</hi> a ſtrong Town, ſtormed it, and took it with the ſlaughter of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Feltmarſhal, and moſt of his men, and got in it above one hundred Braſs-guns, and much Ammunition. After this a vehement Froſt being commanded from Heaven to favour him with a Bridg, he ſtept over the Ice from Iſle to Iſle on the <hi>Belt,</hi> where he forced the <hi>Dane</hi> to accept of ſuch conditions as he impoſed, which were both diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and diſadvantageous. Sure if the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had been perſonally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his forces, he had at leaſt once fought for it.</p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:97406:137"/>
                  <p>To make War in perſon ſeems to be one of the eſſential Duties of a King or Soveraign Prince; this was one of thoſe reaſons which the people of God gave for their deſire to have a King to rule over them, <hi>To do juſtice among our ſelves,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> made War i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>and to lead out our armies to battel againſt our enemies,</hi> and they add, <hi>after the manner of other Nations.</hi> So then it is clear that Kings at that time went to the field in perſon. So did <hi>Saul</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo did <hi>David,</hi> and moſt of all his Succeſſors Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And if it be objected that <hi>David</hi> made <hi>Joab</hi> his Captain General, I give two anſwers, firſt <hi>Joab</hi>'s authority ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when <hi>David</hi> was preſent, which he was almoſt conſtantly with his forces,<note place="margin">The objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Joab</hi> anſwer'd.</note> till he was eſtabliſhed King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For <hi>Joab</hi>'s employment where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in chief, (if I have obſerved right) was firſt againſt the Rebel <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and this was a Civil War, and then againſt the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and that was a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign War, both theſe had their riſe from ſudden Emergencies.

If any War had fallen out, probably <hi>Solomon</hi> would have conducted his forces himſelf. But his reign was peaceable, as being the Type of the Prince of Peace; yet he might have repented it if he had confer'd that high truſt on <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who if he had been Captain General, probably would not have fled to <hi>Egypt</hi> for fear of King <hi>Solomon;</hi> for his actions againſt <hi>Rehoboam</hi> declared af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, that the heart of a Rebel was within his breaſt, whatever his exterior deportment was in the time of that peaceable King.</p>
                  <p>But to what I have ſaid, That Soveraign Princes ſhould conduct their armies<note place="margin" type="runSum">Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what hath been ſaid. Firſt,</note> in perſon, it will be objected, That an Infant King cannot manage a War: To which I anſwer, that then the Prince neareſt in blood ſhould do it, as well as he ſhould govern in Civil affairs. And if it be ſaid, he may uſurp; I anſwer, Better he do ſo than a fellow ſubject, who may play the like prank, if he be inveſted with the like power. But it is known that many Infant Kings have been carried<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer'd.</note> about with their armies to encourage them, ſo great an influence hath the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Soveraign power, (though in a Child) over the ſpirits of Military perſons.

                  <p>In the ſecond place it will be askt what ſhall an old decrepit, or Valetudinary<note place="margin" type="runSum">The Second,</note> King do, who is not able to go to the field? Truly I ſhall not deſire him to do as that King of <hi>Morocco</hi> did, who in the Battel he fought with <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> King of <hi>Portugal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> cauſed himſelf to be carried in a Litter, whereby he gain'd the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, though with the loſs of his own life in the field. But I ſay ſuch a King<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer'd.</note> may intruſt as many of his ſubjects as are able and capable to lead armies, but he ſhould put the managing the great bulk of the War principally in the hands of the heir of the Crown to command over all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if he be not of age fit for it, then that great truſt ſhould be given to the next Prince of the blood, who is capable of it. When the Imperial and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> forces Invaded <hi>France</hi> in the year 1635, the <hi>French</hi> King made his Brother <hi>Gaſton</hi> Generaliſſimo, who chac'd the enemy out of the Kingdom. After the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second had ſuffer'd many loſſes, at laſt he made his own Son the <hi>Hungarian</hi> King, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſſimo over all his armies, who at his very firſt Encounter with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> routed two of their armies at <hi>Nordling</hi> in the year 1634, and in the ſpace of two months made them loſe more ground than they had gain'd in two whole years before.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it will be ſaid a Soveraign Queen cannot lead armies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin" type="runSum">The Third<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> cannot manage the War in perſon. I ſhall not anſwer, that many Princeſſes have done it gloriouſly and ſucceſsfully both in ancient and modern times, and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:97406:138"/> therefore all ſhould imitate them. But I ſhall ſay, that ſhe can imploy no better nor fitter Captain General than him who is neareſt in blood to her ſelf, for he is moſt proper to repreſent the Soveraign power who is next to it. I confeſs Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England</hi> did not ſo, and yet was fortunate in all her Wars,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> ſhe had very gallant and loyal Subjects, neither was it in her power to make that choice I ſpoke of, becauſe he who was next to her in blood, was a Soveraign Prince of another Kingdom. And if it be objected that <hi>Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> manag'd her <hi>German</hi> War fortunately under the Conduct of ſeveral brave Captains, who were not of the blood: I ſhall anſwer it is true, yet for all that, I aver that all of them did not ſo much in ſixteen years time after the death of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> as he did alone in the ſpace of two years. And <hi>Chriſtina</hi> at length found it neceſſary to give the great truſt of all her armies in <hi>Germany</hi> to her neareſt Couſin the Count Palatine, and ſend him over with the Title of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraliſſimo, which ſhe never beſtowed on any of her Subjects.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it will be ſaid, that a free State muſt chuſe and truſt a Captain<note place="margin" type="runSum">The Fourth,</note> General with their forces, for a State cannot go to the Field in perſon, as little can it ſend one of their blood, for he may be a near kinſman to two or three of the State, and have no relation to the reſt. To which I anſwer, that I look upon it as an intrinſecal defect in all free States, whether Ariſtocratical, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> that a pure neceſſity is put upon them to intruſt their armies to ſuch a General, as they in their prudence make choice of, and of whom frequently<note place="margin">All Free States jealous of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals.</note> they live in a perpetual jealouſie, fearing his uſurpation almoſt as much as a profeſt enemies invaſion; and for that reaſon they do often limit his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with ſo many reſtrictions, and give him ſuch Committees and Councellors about him, that he is forc'd many times to let ſlip fair occaſions, wherein he might have done the enemy great miſchief, and his Maſters eminent ſervice. And in the election of their General, it is no ſmall queſtion in a State, Whether it be beſt to chuſe a native or a ſtranger?

This was likewiſe <hi>Joabs</hi> inexcuſable fault, who preſuming on the greatneſs of his Office, rather than that of his ſervices, was many times too ſaucy with his Prince: And though <hi>Abner</hi> deſerved a worſe death, than that he got, yet he deſerved it not from <hi>Joab, Davids</hi> ſervant; and, no doubt, it was intolerable preſumption in <hi>Joab</hi> to revenge his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Death on a man, with whom his Maſter had but juſt now entred into League: And though perhaps the ſame <hi>Joab</hi> had enough of reaſon of State on his ſide, for killing <hi>Abſolom,</hi> yet it was his duty, to have uſed him as the King bad him; for Princes love to be ſerved in their own way, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhould be the Glory of Subjects.

As <hi>Francis Sforza,</hi> Father of him who Uſurped <hi>Millan,</hi> deſerted <hi>Joanne</hi> Queen of <hi>Naples,</hi> and went over to her Enemy of <hi>Arragon.</hi> I humbly think, that a Prince who hath many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſhould be either by himſelf, or one of his Blood preſent with one of them, and entruſt the reſt to perſons of known abilities, who ſhould have no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er titles, than that of Lieutenant Generals, and are to be independent one of another, and this will make them emulous, endeavouring which of them ſhall do their Maſter beſt ſervice; but when Reaſon of War requires a conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Forces, then as I have often ſaid, the Prince, or one of his Blood ſhould have the ſupreme command; for to a Prince, all the Lieutenant Generals will give ready and ſubmiſſive obedience, without repining, grudging or murmuring, which men ordinarily do not to fellow-Subjects. <hi>Charles the</hi> Ninth of <hi>France,</hi> made but a ſorry progreſs in his Wars againſt his Proteſtant Subjects, till he made his Brother <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> his Captain General, who though he was<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Kings Brother Generaliſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo.</note> but very young, yet all the Kings Generals giving him an intire obedience, in a ſhort time he brought thoſe of the Religion, to a very low and petitioning condition.

Very young this General ought not to be, for he muſt not be a <hi>meer novitiat,</hi> (I ſpeak ſtill of Subjects;) very old he muſt not be, for age dries up the radical moiſture, cools the blood, and weakens the body, and thereby makes a man unfit for theſe Actions, which require both preſent reſolution, and preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition: In ſhort, if you have a General indued with ſome knowledge in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Affairs, with ſome prudence, with ſome liberality, and an unblemiſh'd reputation; he may paſs for ſufficient enough, though he have not all theſe qualities in the Superlative degree: for perfection is not to be look'd for in
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:97406:140"/> the depraved condition of mankind. As to Stratagems, if he be witty, he needs not loſe his time to read <hi>Frontinus;</hi> for as <hi>Xenophon</hi> tells us, a General ſhould<note place="margin">Stratagems.</note> know how to invent Stratagems of his own, as well as to know thoſe who have been before him, as that Muſician is the better Artiſt, who can make new Tunes, than he who can only ſing or play old ones. And in all thoſe qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I have now ſpoke of, all General perſons are invited to take a ſhare.</p>
                  <p>But there are ſome who in the choice of a General require another qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that is that he be fortunate; but how ſhall you know whether he will be fortunate in his future undertakings? if you ſay, becauſe he was happy in his lower imployments, you will take your meaſures very ill; for many are fit to conduct parties or parcels of armies, and to follow ſuch directions as are given them, who are very uncapable to manage the charge of a whole army; and it is very well known that a Commander in the Wars may be fortunate enough un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">Fortune un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant.</note> one Maſter, and very unfortunate under another. Beſides, fortune is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in all things, and in nothing more than in matters of War. I knew when Count <hi>Koningſmark</hi> was Major, Lieutenant Colonel, and Colonel, no enterpriſe ſucceeded well with him, nor had he fortune favourable in any party he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted. But when he came to have a petty army under his own peculiar Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, all went well with him, and as he was advanced to higher imployments, fortune attended him more and more, ſo that he was eſteemed to be one of the moſt ſucceſsful Generals Queen <hi>Chriſtina</hi> of <hi>Sweden</hi> had; but obſerve the change, when he came to ſerve the late King of <hi>Sweden</hi> in his War againſt <hi>Pole,</hi> this <hi>Koningſmark</hi> is pitifully taken at Sea by the <hi>Dantzickers,</hi> and kept Priſoner till the Peace was made. It hath indeed been obſerved of ſome, that they have loſt all the Battels that ever they fought, as if ſome inexorable deſtiny had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly<note place="margin">Some never fortunate.</note> attended their perſons, how brave and accompliſht ſoever they were. They ſay never Battel was won for <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth of <hi>England,</hi> when he was<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </note> perſonally preſent, but ſeveral were when he was abſent. There was one of our Earls of <hi>Douglas,</hi> who had the nick-name of <hi>Tinefield,</hi> or Looſe-battel, a couragious perſon, and well experienced in the managing of the Wars of thoſe<note place="margin">One of the Earls of <hi>Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas.</hi>
                     </note> times, and though he wanted no qualification of a good Captain, yet loſt he all the Battels that ever he fought; and this ill fortune attended him when he join'd with <hi>Piercy</hi> in his Rebellion againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth King of <hi>England,</hi> for that Battel was loſt, wherein he thought he had kill'd three or four Kings, and he himſelf was taken Priſoner. The ſame rigid fate attended him over to <hi>France,</hi> where fighting at <hi>Vernouville</hi> againſt the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> he loſt both the Battel and his Life.</p>
                  <p>There is another extravagant opinion, that it is good for a General to be once beaten, that he may thereafter ſhun thoſe errors which occaſion'd his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw;<note place="margin">An odd opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> but the Eſcapes, neglects, and Miſtakes in the time of Action, are ſo many, that if a General did not endeavour to prevent them, till by every one of them he loſt a Battel, Conflict, or Rencounter, he ſhould never win a Field in his life. A great deal better it is, ſaith <hi>Monluc,</hi> for a Captain to be wiſe by the loſs of other men, than by his own, and by the neglect of others, (who thereby have ſhipwrackt themſelves) to ſteer his courſe ſo that he ſplit not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſame rock.</p>

Many brave Generals and Captains (when their armies are irrecoverably routed in the field) are forc'd to fly, and ſo preſerve themſelves to better fortunes; ſo on the other hand many armies have been ſav'd, and have gain'd the day, after their Generals have either fled out of the field, or been kill'd in it. At a Battel fought with the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Loſs of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral doth not loſe an army.</note> in the year 1638, <hi>Paltſgrave Birkifeld</hi> fled with moſt of his General perſons, yet his army gain'd the Victory; and in our own days the Generals of three ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, join'd at that time all in one, fled before the Battel was half fought, yet the miſhap was that the General who fought againſt them, and bravely kept the field, loſt the honour of the day. <hi>Titus Livius</hi> tells us, that the two <hi>Decii,</hi> Father and Son, both Conſuls in two ſeveral Battels which the <hi>Romans</hi> fought with their neighbours in <hi>Italy,</hi> when they ſaw their own men began to fly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated and devoted themſelves and their prevailing enemies to Mother <hi>Tellus,</hi> and all the Infernal ſpirits, with all the Helliſh rites of that Heathen action de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd at length by <hi>Livy,</hi> that thereby the <hi>Roman</hi> army might recover the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour<note place="margin">Inſtances for it of ancient times.</note> of the Field well near loſt, and ſo they being bravely mounted rode among the thickeſt of their enemies, where valiantly fighting, both of them were kill'd, which made Victory preſently turn over to the <hi>Romans.</hi> But we muſt not believe with <hi>Livius,</hi> that the Conſuls bequeathing themſelves ſo heartily to the Devil was ſo acceptable a ſacrifice to heaven, or ſo ſupererogatory as to move the Gods to reward it with ſucceſs to their party; no, it was that exceſs of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour which they ſhew'd in the action, that encourag'd the flying <hi>Romans</hi> to turn head, and follow their Generals in that deſperate Charge, and I doubt not but the deaths of their Conſuls exaſperated them, and put an edge on their revenge, and that procur'd them the Victory. The ſame Author informs us that a <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul, one <hi>Petilius Laetus</hi> fighting bravely againſt the <hi>Ligurians</hi> was kill'd, to revenge whoſe death the <hi>Romans</hi> fought ſo well, that they chac'd their enemies out of the Field. <hi>Polybius</hi> in his ſecond Book ſpeaks of a very remarkable Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel which two <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls fought with two <hi>Gallick</hi> Kings, the two Conſuls having marched with two ſeveral armies two ſeveral ways by a ſtrange Chance met in ſuch a manner, that one of them began the skirmiſh with the Van of the <hi>Gauls</hi> army, when the other began to attack their reer, but at the firſt ſhock one of the Conſuls was kill'd, to revenge whoſe death his army charg'd and fought thorough the <hi>Gauls,</hi> routed them totally, kill'd on the place forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, and took ten thouſand, with one of their Kings.

                  <p>But to come nearer home and our own days, <hi>Maurice</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxe</hi> in the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifths time, was kill'd in that Battel he fought with <hi>Albert</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> yet his army got the victory.

The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> who ſucceeded that <hi>Bourbon</hi> in the command of that ſame Imperial army, was kill'd in a hot encounter with the <hi>Florentine</hi> General <hi>Ferrucci,</hi> yet his army was Victorious. The great King of <hi>Sweden, Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> was kill'd even as the Battel of <hi>Lutzen</hi> began, yet did his army fight bravely the whole day, and forc'd the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> to go out of the field at night. I knew Feltmarſhal <hi>Kniphauſin</hi> a good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, while he was marſhalling the few forces he had at <hi>Haſalon</hi> in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Munſter</hi> againſt one <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And to conclude, a General may loſe more to his Prince, by too much care to preſerve his own perſon, than by freely hazarding it. Now as our General is bound to give proofs of his courage, ſo in time of action he ought to be of an excellent temper, for if at that time he be tranſported with vanity, preſumption, credulity; or other perturbations of ſoul, he may either hazard too much, or not hazard at all; for theſe or any of theſe paſſions may move him to give thoſe Orders and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which may eaſily make him loſe the day, and with it the ſervice of his Maſter, and his own Reputation for ever.</p>

                  <p>Almoſt every Soldier can tell you, that in all armies Intelligence is the life of action, but how to get good Intelligence to which a General or any Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may truſt, is an Art yet to be found out, and I ſay more, it will never be

This truth of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of all Intelligence in Military affairs, which I aſſert, will beſt appear if we examine all the kinds of Intelligence that can be had, and theſe I ſuppoſe can be no more but two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> publick and private Intelligence. Every one of theſe will admit of a ſubdiviſion, for both of them are of ſeveral ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Publick Intelligence is got firſt by thoſe parties whether ſtronger or weaker,<note place="margin">Publick Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence by ſtronger par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</note> whether of Horſe or Foot, that are ſent either from an army, a part of it, or from a Garriſon, to learn thoſe things, or ſome of them that I have mention'd in the beginning of this Chapter. If the party be to go far, it is to be the ſtronger, and to divide, ſome part of it is to ſtay behind at ſome paſs or ſtrait, to ſecure the retreat of thoſe who advance further. Now ſuppoſe this ſtrong party meets no oppoſition, but returns ſafely, the Intelligence they bring is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Very often falſe.</note> from the Country people, which ſignifies but little, and for moſt part juſt nothing, or elſe the party hath taken ſome Priſoners. Theſe can tell you how ſtrong they conceive your enemy is, where he was yeſterday, or where he was this morning, but cannot tell you where he will be this night or to morrow, nor can they tell you any of his deſigns or intentions; and if any of the two, either Country people or Soldiers undertake to reveal the ſecrets of the Enemies Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to you, you are unhappy if you truſt them, for ordinarily they ſpeak ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorantly or falſly; and it is certain, that either a Fool or a Knave may ruin you if you believe either of them.

You may read it at large in <hi>Livies</hi> Ninth Book. <hi>Curio, Caeſar</hi>'s Legate in <hi>Africk,</hi> a good Soldier, believ'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that ſome Priſoners whom he had taken from the enemy, gave him, which was, that <hi>Juba</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania</hi> was gone home from <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> and had taken moſt of his army with him, but had left behind him his Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Sabuca,</hi> with ſome few forces, upon which the Credulous <hi>Curio</hi> marcheth out of his well fortified Camp, ſought out the King who waited for him, fought and was beaten, hardly being able to make a retreat to his Leaguer, where he loſt his life. <hi>Caeſar</hi> hath it in the Ninth Book <hi>De Bello Civili.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When you ſend a ſmaller party for Intelligence, it muſt not be far, it is done<note place="margin">Publick Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence by ſmaller par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to be truſted:</note> when an enemy is near; theſe are to diſcover, or as it is commonly called, to recognoſce, it is ordinarily of an odd or uneven number, as ſeven, nine, eleven, thirteen, fifteen, or more. If it conſiſts of fifteen, three may go before, four follow to ſuſtain them, and then eight to receive the other ſeven. Suppoſe they come ſafe back, they bring you word that at ſuch a diſtance they ſaw no enemy at all, or they ſaw ſuch a number in ſuch a place, or they ſaw their whole army marching; you have reaſon upon this to draw up in Battel, if you be not ſtrongly encamped, yet the marching army may prove Trees, or Cows at beſt; I have ſometime ſeen the like of this fall out. But this weaker party perhaps brings you a Priſoner or two, if ſo, it hath done much; but what you are to truſt to of a Priſoners Intelligence, I have already told you. And here, as the Proverb goes, a <hi>Tartar</hi> may be taken, your party may be beaten, and ſome of them if not all made Priſoners; you will ſay you care not, none of them can tell your intentions; I believe you, but if that be true, then thoſe you take from your enemy, can tell as little of his.

This Intelligence made the great <hi>Caeſar</hi> immediately alter his reſolution, which was to have fallen on the <hi>Helvetians</hi> that very day, for he was in great want of Proviſions: Well, he drew off, and encamped on the next hill, and when the day was well ſpent, he came to know that <hi>Labienus</hi> and his two Legions had poſſeſt that hill as they were appointed, that <hi>Conſidius</hi> had out of fear imagin'd the <hi>Romans</hi> to be <hi>Switzers,</hi> and that the enemy was march'd away far enough. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſteps aſide to look for bread to his hungry army; the fooliſh <hi>Helvetians</hi> thinking he had fled for fear, follow'd him to their loſs, otherwiſe they had eſcap'd him for that time, perhaps for good and all. Thus <hi>Caeſar</hi> by miſintelligence was like to have loſt a fair opportunity to fight his enemy; and whom ſhould he truſt, if he might not truſt a Veteran Captain, and as himſelf calls him, <hi>Rei Militaris peritiſſimum,</hi> moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in Military affairs?</p>
                  <p>The ſecond inſtance is, when <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt made his Retreat from <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drecy</hi>
                     <note place="margin">And in <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth,</note> and <hi>Guiſe,</hi> he encamped one night in view of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, who follow'd him, making ſhow as if he intended to fight <hi>Charles</hi> the next day; about break of day one <hi>Zalaſar</hi> a brave and experienced Captain, was<note place="margin">And <hi>Zalaſar</hi> one of his Captains.</note> ſent to diſcover, who at his return aſſur'd the Emperour that the <hi>French</hi> King was lying ſtill in the ſame poſture he was in the night before, and that a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Switzers</hi> had the outer guards, and ſeveral pieces of Artillery with them: fair day-light made his error known, the <hi>French</hi> army was got clear away, thoſe that <hi>Zalaſar</hi> took for <hi>Switzers</hi> were the Emperours own guards of <hi>Germans,</hi> and his Pieces of Ordnance were old Trunks of Trees. This made the poor Gentleman ridiculous to that whole army, in which he formerly had ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and did worſe than that, for his miſintelligence loſt him his Maſters fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, who by it loſt the opportunity of taking his advantage of the reer of the <hi>French</hi> army.</p>
                  <p>If you ask me what ſhall be done in this caſe, I anſwer, the uſual cuſtom muſt be followed, Intelligence muſt be both ſought and bought; for parties, forlorn<note place="margin">Yet Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence muſt ſtill be look'd after.</note> Troops, ſmaller bodies of Horſe, and ſometimes of Foot, muſt be ſent out for Intelligence: neither can any army, or part of an army march with any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, unleſs ſome be ſent before to diſcover. The want of theſe made the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> army under <hi>Flaminius</hi> become a prey to <hi>Hannibal</hi> at the Lake <hi>Thraſimenes,</hi> where the Conſul loſt his life. I am not ſo vain as to give any new rules for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence; all I pretend to in this place is to demonſtrate that no Intelligence can be ſo exactly good, but it may prove wrong, nor can any be ſent for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence be they never ſo witty and expert, but they may miſtake. Neither is<note place="margin">No truſt to an enemies Intelligence.</note> there any Intelligence more to be doubted or misbelieved than that which comes from an enemy; <hi>Sabinus</hi> one of <hi>Caeſars</hi> Legates truſted what <hi>Ambiorix</hi> a petty King of the <hi>Gauls</hi> in publick hoſtility with him, reported; this coſt the lives of a Legion and five Cohorts of <hi>Romans,</hi> beſides that of the Legate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Cicero</hi> another Legate not giving truſt to the ſame <hi>Ambiorix,</hi> ſav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Legion till <hi>Caeſar</hi> came and reliev'd him out of eminent danger.</p>
                  <p>There be other ways of publick Intelligence by ſhots of Cannon or Muſquets,<note place="margin">Other ways of publick Intelligence.</note> from Hills, Mountains, Towers, or Trees, as alſo by Beacons with ſmoke by day, and fire by night. I confeſs in ſome caſes there can be no better way found out, yet theſe may readily prove uncertain, as many times they have done; for your Centinels and Guards may make theſe ſhots and ſigns upon miſapprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo diſturb you with falſe alarms, or an enemy may have ſurpriz'd your
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:97406:142"/> Guards and Centinels, and by giving you no ſign, or falſe ſigns, ruin you. Intelligence may alſo be given publickly from the Steeples and Towers of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged places, and from Mountains without, by either Cannon or fire, by ſigns, and Counter-ſigns, yet all of them may be miſunderſtood, miſcarried, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd. But more of this in my Diſcourſe of Beſieged Cities, Towns, and Caſtles.</p>
                  <p>Private Intelligence is got by word, or by writing either from thoſe who<note place="margin">Private Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence by word, or by writ,</note> dwell and converſe with your enemy, or thoſe you ſend among your enemies diſguiſed as their friends. To corrupt a Secretary of a Prince or a General, is a good way for Intelligence; and to do this, he who commands an army muſt ſpare no Gold, and therefore a Parſimonious General will have but bad private Intelligence, or rather none at all. Governours of Forts, and Officers to whom Poſts are intruſted, either in Garriſon or Field, muſt be tried how they may be corrupted. This is an excellent way for Intelligence, and makes the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an enemy eaſie, and it ought to be attempted, eſſay'd, and proſecuted with all earneſtneſs, prudence, and ſecrecy. One will do wiſely to ſeem to give full credit to the Propoſals, Intelligence and promiſes of theſe Traytors, but he muſt not always do it, for in this the rule will hold exactly, <hi>Diſce diffidere,</hi> learn to diſtruſt. How many Generals and other great perſons have been chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſuch ſeeming Traytors, Hiſtory and daily practice bear witneſs. In the<note place="margin">Proves often falſe.</note> time of the Civil Wars of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth's reign, a Proteſtant Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer within <hi>Orleance</hi> agreed with much ſecrecy to deliver one of the Ports to the enemy who beſieg'd the Town, and accordingly ſome hundreds were admitted within the City, who were all Maſſacred, and a number of great Guns and Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets were fir'd on thoſe who were following, after the Portculleys were let down, and the Drawbridg was pluckt up. Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> was little better uſed with his Intelligence out of <hi>Aloſt.</hi> Such an entertainment was prepar'd for five or ſix thouſand <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to whom <hi>Breda</hi> ſhould have been deliver'd in the night-time, when the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> govern'd, if I remember right, but when they came near the Town, they grew jealous, and ſo return'd with little loſs.</p>
                  <p>In the next place Generals ought to have a wary eye over their Secretaries; I believe few of them truſt them with all their ſecrets, nor is it fit they ſhould. And what truſt can you give him, who is willing to betray his Maſter to whom<note place="margin">A Traytors Intelligence to be diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> he hath ſworn fidelity? ſhould you not be afraid that he will rather betray you to whom he hath ſworn none? Yet this way of Intelligence hath in all ages been tried, and hath very often prov'd ſucceſsful, and therefore it muſt be ſtill pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, and ſomething muſt be hazarded, for all cannot be made cockſure. <hi>Wallenſtein</hi> as was afterward well known, really intended to have betrayed the Emperour his Maſter, and all his armies; but the Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> and other <hi>Swediſh</hi> Generals durſt not truſt him, till they got aſſurances, and before he could give theſe he was diſpatched to another world. Wherefore I ſay, ſomething muſt be adventur'd, but let it be done with all imaginable care and circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that if your Intelligence fail you, the loſs may not be conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>Written Intelligence is very dangerous, both for the perſon that carries it,<note place="margin">Written In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence dangerous.</note> for him who ſends it, and for him who receives it. If the bearer of it be taken he will no doubt be put to exquiſite tortures till he tell from whom he brought it, and be hang'd when he hath told it; this brings the ſender or writer in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his life, and the intercepting this written Intelligence divulgeth ſome of his ſecrets to whom it is ſent, and ſo puts him to new reſolutions, for though the advices he ſent be written in Cyphers, yet the art of finding keys for Cyphers<note place="margin">So are Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</note> is now common; and though a Cypher be not unlockt, yet he to whom it is directed, will rationally conclude it was unlockt, and therefore will find it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to fall upon new reſolves. Other manners of writing with illegible Ink, are<note place="margin">Yet both to be uſed.</note> ſoon found out with fire and water. But notwithſtanding all this there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of writing many times, and it muſt take its hazard.</p>
                  <p>Private Intelligence by word of mouth is certainly the ſureſt way, (if any way of Intelligence can be ſure) provided the perſons imployed be witty, ſober, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant, and faithful. The firſt three qualifications may be known by converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Spies.</note> but the laſt only by frequent trial, and yet he may be faithful to you in many things, who may cheat you to purpoſe at the laſt blow. Theſe be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencers, whether men or women, who are properly called Spies, upon
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:97406:143"/> whoſe Intelligence no prudent General, Governour, or good Officer will build reſolutions, till it be confirm'd by ſeveral hands, and even then it will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<note place="margin">Not always to be truſted.</note> to walk with circumſpection. We find in the life of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> writ both by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and others, that he made it his great work to get Intelligence of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies poſture, doings, and deſigns, and that the wonderful celerity he uſed in all his expeditions, was the product of his Intelligence, yet did he never truſt any that ever he got from either friend or enemy, till it was confirm'd to him from others; yet I have told you that his Intelligence did fail, it is true not ſo oft as his Legates were abus'd by theirs, becauſe he truſted not ſo eaſily. When Spies are ſent, he who ſends them muſt let them know none of his own deſigns,<note place="margin">Their miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> for theſe they may readily reveal. Theſe Spies are in a woful condition, for ſo ſoon as they are ſuſpected, they are immediately ſearch'd, and if any Papers be found about them, either in their Clothes, the ſoles of their ſhoos, their hair, hats, ſheaths of daggers or ſwords, they are put to torture, and then all they know for moſt part is reveal'd, and though no Papers be found with them, yet are they tortur'd to tell what perhaps they know not. The <hi>Roman</hi> way to<note place="margin">How the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> found out Spies.</note> find out Spies was by a Trumpet or a Cryer to command all to their Huts and Tents, and thoſe who were then found wandering abroad, were apprehended, and examin'd for Spies.</p>
                  <p>But I do not remember to have heard or read of a greater miſchief, that want of Intelligence did to any than to the two famous <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Brothers, <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> and <hi>Aſdrubal:</hi> for after the laſt's arrival in <hi>Italy, Hannibal</hi> faceth one <hi>Roman</hi> army, reſolving to hinder it to join with another, which he knew was ſent to hinder his Brother to join with him; <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> faceth the other <hi>Roman</hi> army<note place="margin">Two great Captains both Brothers, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd for want of Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> under Conſul <hi>Livius,</hi> and provoketh him to Battel, but in vain. All the four armies are encamped and fortified, each diligently obſerving the motions of his adverſary. Yet <hi>Claudius Nero</hi> the Conſul who oppoſed <hi>Hannibal,</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the night with ſix thouſand commanded <hi>Romans</hi> out of his Camp, joins with <hi>Livius,</hi> who was at leaſt a hundred miles diſtant from him, without the knowledg of either of the two Brothers. Neither had <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> any knowledg of the Conjunction but his own conjecture by the numbers of the Horſes that he ſaw go out to watering, and the two <hi>Claſſicums,</hi> the Badges of two Conſuls; he reti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>'d that night, but was overtaken next day, beaten and kill'd. Nor did <hi>Hannibal</hi> know any thing of the whole matter, till <hi>Nero</hi> was return'd in ſafety to the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, and that he cauſed <hi>Aſdrubals</hi> head to be thrown before one of the Gates of <hi>Hannibals;</hi> at the ſight where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Gallant <hi>Carthaginian</hi> wept, and ſaid, he now ſaw too well the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of <hi>Carthage;</hi> meaning no doubt, that the Heavens were not to be any more propitious to that powerful City, when ſuch two famous Warriors as himſelf and his valiant Brother were ruin'd for want of Intelligence. For,</p>

                  <q>

                  <p>But to return to our Spies, to put them to death without mercy, or to<note place="margin">The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Spies very ſevere.</note> uſe them worſe, hath been ſo ancient, and ſtill is ſo univerſal a practice, that to ſpeak any thing againſt the injuſtice of it, might juſtly make a man ridiculouſly ſingular. In ancient times for moſt part they were tortur'd to death, and little better are they uſed in the Modern War. But do not you think the <hi>Romans</hi> uſed Spies more mercifully at the Siege of <hi>Capua,</hi> who only cut off their hands and noſes, and ſo let them depart in peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caeſar</hi> who was merciful enough, and made great uſe of Spies himſelf, cauſed the hands of two meſſengers to be cut off, who were taken carrying Letters from <hi>Corduba</hi> to young <hi>Pompey;</hi> and in the ſame War he apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded four Spies in his Camp, one was a Soldier, and three were Slaves, the Soldier he beheaded, but the Slaves he Crucified. So you ſee Soldiers muſt be ſubject to the puniſhment of Spies if they ſuffer themſelves to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in their office. But ſince Spies are made uſe of by all Commanders in the Wars, by all Generals, nay by all Princes, why is there a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere animadverſion againſt them, than againſt Robbers, Murderers, yea Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricides?
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:97406:143"/> They are not only allowed, made uſe of, and commended, but bountifully rewarded by thoſe who imploy them; why then is not there ſome capitulation for them, or at leaſt ſome greater mitigation of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, than to deliver them over to the cruelty of a Butcherly Hangman,<note place="margin">Spies may be lawfully uſed.</note> to whip, torture, hang, ſpit and quarter them? Certainly their Office is lawful, otherwiſe lawful Princes would not make uſe of them; why are they then ſo horribly puniſht for going about their duty? Yes, aſſuredly their Office is lawful, ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> by Gods own appointment ſent a dozen of them to ſpy the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> one whereof was <hi>Caleb,</hi> who went in and poſſeſt his ſhare of it, and another of the Twelve was <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> who thereafter was Captain General of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Army. Two Spies were likewiſe ſent to <hi>Jericho,</hi> who ow'd the ſafety of their lives to the Harlot <hi>Rachab,</hi> and when they lodg'd at ſuch a womans houſe, had they not been ſent by Gods own people, might not a man have ſaid, that Knaves and Whores were well met together?</p>
                  <p>But to conclude, if Spies eſcap'd without very ſevere puniſhment, Camps, Armies, and all Fortified places would be peſter'd with that baſe, though neceſſary Canaille.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have a General Officer whom they qualifie with the Title of Scoutmaſter General, I have known none of them abroad, but I hear in ſome<note place="margin">Scout-maſter General.</note> places of <hi>Italy</hi> they have ſomething very like him, and that is, <hi>Il Capitano di Spiani,</hi> the Captain of the Spies. I cannot believe that this Scoutmaſter, or this Captain hath any thing to do with that Intelligence, which I called publick, and is got by parties whether of Horſe or Foot; for the commanding theſe out, and the keeping the Liſts of their Turns or Toures belongs properly to the Major Generals, and ſeveral Majors of Regiments both of the Cavalry and Infantry, none whereof I conceive will ſuffer the Scoutmaſter to uſurp their Office. They muſt then only have the regulation of the private Intelligence, wherein no doubt they may eaſe the General of the Army very much. But being that Spies are properly under their command, if this Scoutmaſter General, or this <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tano di Spiani</hi> be taken Priſoner by the enemy, whether he may be ranſom'd and uſed as an Officer, or hanged as a Spy, is a queſtion, which becauſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine, I ſhall leave it as a Probleme. The <hi>French</hi> have lately conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Captain of Guides, who perhaps is the Captain of Spies I ſpeak of.</p>

                  <p>THE great Apoſtle of the Gentiles tells us, <hi>That the faſhion of this world periſheth;</hi> And truly <hi>I</hi> admire not at all, that Embatteling Bodies of Foot and Horſe by the Square-root is worn out of faſhion, but <hi>I</hi> admire much that<note place="margin">Several kinds of Batallions marſhal'd by the Square<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>root.</note> ever it was in faſhion. I ſhall not offer to prepoſſeſs my Reader with a bad opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it till I inform him of the thing it ſelf. Authors mention Batallions ſquare of men, and Batallions ſquare of ground, Batallions of a large front, and doubled Batallions. To theſe by the permiſſion of thoſe Speculative Martialiſts, I ſhall add another, and that is a Batallion ſquare both of men and ground, whereof I do not remember that I have heard any of them either ſpeak or write.</p>
                  <p>It will be requiſite for that Commander who intends to draw up his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Regiment or Brigade by the Square-root, to have Tables of ſeveral num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by him, whereof the <hi>Sieur de Preiſſuc, Bockl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As 3 multiplied by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> produceth 9, 9 multiplied by 9 produceth 81, 81 multiplied by 81 produceth 6561<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in it ſelf multiply 6561, the product will be 43046721, and ſo in <hi>infinitum.</hi> But obſerve firſt, that all numbers are not ſquare, and of theſe that are ſquare you may extract the root without a fraction, as a 100 is a ſquare num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, becauſe the root of it is 10 without a fraction; for 10 multiplied by 10 produceth a 100. But when you extract the root of a number that is not ſquare, you muſt take the neareſt, as 10 and 11 are not ſquare numbers, and therefore you muſt take the root of 9, and that is 3, now 3 multiplied by 3 produceth but nine, and ſo in 10 you have the fraction of one, and in 11 of two. Obſerve, ſecondly, that every number above 10 hath for its ſquare a number above a 100, as 11 multiplied by 11 produceth 121. Obſerve thirdly, that the root of a<note place="margin">Three neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> ſquare figure is the ſide of it, and in a quadrate ſquare all the ſides are of a like length; ſo that if you would know the ſuperficial contents of a ſquare figure aequilateral, you multiply the number of one ſide by it ſelf, as by example if the number of one ſide of that figure be a 100 men, the Product will be 10000: But if it be an oblong ſquare, that is, which hath two ſides longer than the other two, you are to multiply the length of one of the longeſt by the length of one of the ſhorteſt; as by example, there is an oblong ſquare, whereof each of two ſides contain a 100 Foot, and each of the other two ſides but 50, multiply then the longeſt by the ſhorteſt, that is a 100 by 50, the Product will be five thouſand.</p>
                  <p>This being premiſed, if you would have a ſquare Batallion of men, you are firſt to ſee what the number of your men is, and next extract the root of that number, and according to it, form your Body of equal number of men in rank<note place="margin">Batallions ſquare of men, how made.</note> and file. As the number of your men to be marſhall'd is 256, which was the number of the <hi>Grecian Syntagma</hi> or Company, extract the root of 256, you will find it to be 16, for 16 multiplied by it ſelf, produceth 256, and therefore your rank and your file muſt each conſiſt of 16 men, this is a Batallion ſquare of men. Or ſuppoſe your number to be 6560, you will find it is not a ſquare number, and therefore you muſt take the root of the next ſquare number to 6560, and that you will find to be 6561, the root whereof you will find to be 81, for 81 multiplied by it ſelf produceth 6561, and therefore to marſhal 6560, you muſt make your rank conſiſt of 81 men, and your file of as many. But truly you will not find this ſo eaſie to be done in the field, as on a piece of Paper, and when you have done it, perhaps you will ſay it was not worth the half of your pains.</p>

                  <p>To make a Batallion ſquare of ground is to allow no more ground to your front or your rank, than you do to your file or flank, and for this they will give you a rule which will be hard enough to follow on any ſudden occaſion, and it is this, allow ſeven foot in length, and three in breadth for every Soldier; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply<note place="margin">Battallions ſquare of ground.</note> the number of men you are to marſhal by three, and divide the Product by ſeven, then extract the ſquare root of the Quotient, that will be the number of men for your file, by the number of men in your file, you are to divide the whole number of men in your Batallion, and the Quotient of that will be the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men for your rank. This is a little harſh, yet I cannot make it clearer, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps an example will clear it. Suppoſe your men to be 1600, the ordinary num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of weak Brigades, multiply 1600 by three, the Product is 4800. Divide 4800 by ſeven, the Quotient will be 685, with a fraction of five. When you extract the root of 685, (becauſe it is not a ſquare number) you muſt take the neareſt, and that will be 26, for that multiplied in it ſelf produceth 676, and this wants but nine of 685. Then by the rule your file conſiſts of 26, and by it you are to divide your 1600 men, and you will find the Quotient to be 61, with a remainder or fraction of 14; ſo by this rule your rank conſiſts of 61 men, and conſequently your 1600 men come to be 61 in rank, and 26 in file, for 61 multiplied by 26 produceth 1586, which with the fraction of 14 makes juſt 1600. Now three foot being allowed to every man in rank (according to the ordinary computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) 61 men in rank poſſeſſe 183 foot of ground, and ſeven foot being allowed for every man in file, the ground the 26 poſſeſs, is 182 foot, which wants but one of the 183, and that proceeds from the fraction of 14. And hereby you have your Batallion of 1600 men to poſſeſs equal ground, though the rank conſiſt of 61, and the file but of 26. And this you will think is very pretty to ſee or look on, whether it be worth your labour or not, you can beſt tell after you have order'd it, which I ſuppoſe you will not do without ſome trouble. Beſides, in this computation (as I have often ſaid) there is an inexcuſable error com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by moſt men in reckoning Diſtances and Intervals, for they ſtill reckon as many of them, as there be men in rank and file, as here, they make 61 Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals in front, becauſe there are 61 men in front, whereas really there are but 60 Intervals, and in the file they make 26 Intervals, becauſe there are 26 men in file, whereas really there can be no more but 25 Intervals. And theſe two miſtakes will quickly make a vaſt alteration in your Batallions ſquareneſs of ground.</p>
                  <p>A Doubled Batallion is ſo called, when the rank conſiſts of twice as many<note place="margin">A Doubled Batallion.</note> men as the file doth. The way to marſhal it is this: The men you have to order, their number being known, double on paper, for you will, I ſuppoſe, find that more eaſie, than to double their number really in the field. Then extract the ſquare-root of that double number, and that muſt be the number of men for your rank, and the half of that muſt be the number of men for your file. As by example, you are to marſhal 3200 men (the number of ancient Regiments) in a Doubled Batallion, double them, and ſay you have 6400; extract the ſquare root of 6400, you will find it to be 80, for 80 multiplied by 80, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth 6400, and ſo you muſt marſhal your 3200 men 80 in rank, and 40 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the half of 80, your file muſt conſiſt of 40 men, for multiply 80 by 40, the Product is 3200. Take an example of a number that is not ſquare, and let your men be 2500; double theſe, and ſo they are 5000, look for the ſquare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot of 5000, you will not find it exactly, becauſe it is not a ſquare number, and therefore you are to take the neareſt, and that will be 71, for 71 multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it ſelf produceth 5041, and that is 41 more than the double number of your men: let therefore your rank be of 71 men, the half whereof ſhould be the number of your file, this you cannot do exactly, becauſe 71 is an odd number, you muſt therefore take 35, and that is the half of 70, and ſo make your file to conſiſt of 35 men, and you will be near right, for 71 being multiplied by 35, produceth 2485, which wants but 15 of your number of 2500. We read that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> uſed theſe Batallions in the times of old, but now they do not.</p>
                  <p>A Batallion of a large front is that in which there are many more men in the rank, than in file. Theſe Batallions may be form'd eaſily, and they are thoſe<note place="margin">Batallions of a large front.</note> which are now univerſally uſed, but the ſquare root men will needs give us a rule for it; which is of a harder digeſtion than the practice of the thing it ſelf. Yet I ſhall tell you what it is; you ſhall divide your whole men by that number
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:97406:145"/> of which you intend your front ſhall conſiſt, and the Quotient of that Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall be the number of your file; as by example, you are to marſhal a 1000 men, and you intend they ſhall be 50 in rank, divide the 1000 by 50, the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is 20, and ſo your 1000 men ſhall be 50 in rank, and 20 in file. But if you intend to have a 100 in front, you divide a 1000 by a 100, and the Quotient will be 10, and ſo your Batallion hath a 100 in front, and 10 in file, for a 100 multiplied by 10 produceth a 1000. We may ſafely conclude 10000 men may be marſhal'd in this form of Batallion, with the half of this Arithmetick, and is daily practiſed. For at this time all Bodies of Foot drawn up either ten or ſix deep, and Bodies of Horſe three deep, are Batallions of large fronts, and are marſhal'd very well by thoſe who neither know, or ever did hear of a ſquare-root.</p>
                  <p>But let me add to theſe Theoretical marſhallings of a Batallion ſquare both of men and ground, let the number of your men be what it will. And thus, Make firſt as many men in file as in rank, and then you have a Battallion ſquare of men. In the next place allow no more diſtance between your ranks than you do between your files, and then your Batallion is ſquare of ground likewiſe. As for example, you are to draw up 2500 men, extract the root of that number,<note place="margin">A Batallion ſquare of men and ſquare of ground like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</note> you will find it to be 50, for 50 multiplied in it ſelf produceth 2500, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your rank muſt conſiſt of 50 men, and your file of 50 men, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you have a Batallion ſquare of men; then allow as you muſt do, for every Combatant one foot to ſtand on, by that means every rank poſſeſſeth 50 foot, and every file 50 foot. Allow 49 Intervals in the rank, for more there are not, and for every Interval three foot, amounts to 147 foot, and allow no more but three foot for every Interval in the file, you have likewiſe 147 foot for the Intervals of files; now add 147 to 50, which the fighting men ſtand on, the aggregate will be 197, and ſo many foot of ground doth every rank poſſeſs, and ſo much doth every file poſſeſs; and conſequently your Batallion of 2500 is ſquare of ground as well as of men. Would you know how much ground this Batallion ſo marſhal'd poſſeſſeth in all, multiply 197 by 197, and you will find the Product to be 38809 foot, which will be near eight <hi>Italian</hi> miles. But I hear<note place="margin" type="runSum">Objection,</note> you cry out that ſix foot are always allow'd for an Interval between ranks. But I anſwer you negatively, not always, for ſo many Foot are but allowed in<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> a march, becauſe the length of a Pike requires that diſtance, when it is ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, but ſtanding in Battel ready to give or receive the Charge with Pikes either order'd or advanced, three foot are ſufficient for the Pikemen as well as for the Muſqueteers; and when they Charge, one foot and a half of diſtance between ranks of Pikemen is enough. If you will then make uſe of this Batalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mine, let it be with Pikes advanced, but if you be pleas'd to follow my advice, you ſhall never make uſe of it at all.</p>
                  <p>But all theſe forms of Battels fram'd by the ſquare-root, (except the Batalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a large front, which is more eaſily fram'd without it than by it) are of<note place="margin">Moſt of all theſe uſeleſs.</note> much trouble and little uſe, they are theſe which bring feweſt hands to fight, and renders them apt to be ſurrounded, and ſo are all Batallions that have deep files. Next by that manner of Embatteling you muſt conſtantly alter the forms and figures of your Battel, according as the numbers of your men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or decreaſe, and in them there is a daily change. Captain <hi>Cruſo</hi> who <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhed Du Preiſſacs</hi> Military Reſolves, in a Marginal Note calls Embatteling by the ſquare-root an impertinent curioſity; and to what purpoſe, ſaith he, the ſquare-root, ſince now all <hi>Europe</hi> marſhals their foot ten deep, except the <hi>Swede?</hi> for he wrote near forty years ago. And to that ſame ſenſe at this time, I ſay, to what purpoſe the ſquare root, ſince now all <hi>Europe</hi> marſhals their foot ſix deep, and their Horſe three deep, except the <hi>Hollander?</hi> But I ſhall bring you a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter authority againſt deep files, and ſquare-root Battels; <hi>Xenophon</hi> tells us when <hi>Cyrus</hi> fought with <hi>Croeſus</hi> for the Kingdom of <hi>Lidia, Croeſus</hi> his army was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal'd both Horſe and Foot thirty deep, except his Mercenary <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> who were ten thouſand, who would not, ſays he, abandon their Country cuſtom in<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aegyptians</hi> ſquare Batal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of 10000 men.</note> making ſquare Battels, and therefore their 10000 men were drawn up a 100 in rank, and a 100 in file, and a 100 times a 100 makes 10000. And ſo their Batallion was ſquare of men, and might have been alſo of ground if they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd no greater Intervals of ranks than of files, which hardly they could do, being they were all offenſively arm'd with Pikes both long and ſtrong. But our
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:97406:145"/> Author ſaith that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was glad of this, wiſhing <hi>Croeſus</hi>'s whole army had been marſhal'd a thouſand deep, for then he had ſooner deſtroy'd it, as I have told you in the ſecond Chapter of my Diſcourſes of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Art of War. Yet <hi>Xenophon</hi> tells us that theſe <hi>Aegyptians</hi> fought beſt of any of <hi>Croeſus</hi> his army, yea ſo long till they had fair quarter given them. And withal he informs us that <hi>Cyrus</hi> his own army (his Foot I ſuppoſe he means) were marſhal'd 24 deep, and that was eight more than the depth of the <hi>Macedonian Phalanx.</hi>

                  <p>AS all Armies are marſhal'd according to the pleaſure of thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them, ſo their pleaſure often is, and ever ſhould be over ruled by the circumſtances of time, the poſture of the enemy they have to do with, the Weather, the Sun, the Wind, and the ground on which they are to fight, if the General find by his foreparties, or Vancouriers, that his enemy is before him, drawn up in Battel, ready to receive him, he will do himſelf an injury to march forward, for it is not to be fancied, that his adverſary will be ſo courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to permit him to marſhal his army, but will take his advantage and fall upon him, before he can draw up his Van, eſpecially if his march have been thorough any cloſe or ſtrait Country; and in ſuch a condition as that, a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals<note place="margin">A General ſhould have a ready wit.</note> own ready wit and reſolution muſt ſerve him for Counſellors, for there will be no time given him to call a Council of War. But we ſpeak now of Embat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teling Armies, when Generals have half the choice of the ground.</p>
                  <p>The manner was in many places, and ſtill is in ſome, to marſhal Armies in three diſtinct Bodies, one behind another, the firſt was called the Vanguard, the ſecond the Battel, the third the Reer-guard. But ſeveral times every one<note place="margin">Armies mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall'd in three diſtinct Bodies.</note> of thoſe conſiſted of three Bodies likewiſe, theſe were two wings of Horſe, and one Body of Foot; and when they march'd, theſe three great Bodies were called the Van, Battel and Reer. Their proper Title was to be called ſo when they marched, for many times when they drew up in order of Battels, it was in one Breaſt, and then the Horſe were divided in two wings, and the Foot made the Battel. This was done when the ground was very ſpacious, and to prevent ſurrounding, otherwiſe Armies ſeldom fight but in two Battels, if not in three. But as I ſaid, time, ground, the power of an enemy, miniſter occaſions to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of an Army to alter the ordinary cuſtom, and frame a new method of his own to ſerve him for that opportunity. I ſhall give you one inſtance, and that of a mighty army, marſhal'd, as few before it have been, and I believe none ſince. It was that which <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and his Brother King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had at <hi>Vienna,</hi> when they lookt for Sultan <hi>Soliman,</hi> the ground was very ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and though their numbers were very great, yet thoſe of the <hi>Turk</hi> were<note place="margin">How the mighty Army of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>es</hi> the Fifth was marſhal'd at <hi>Vienna.</hi>
                     </note> very much beyond them, and they fear'd to be out-wing'd by his numerous Horſe. The order of their Battel was to be this if they had fought: They had ſixty thouſand arm'd with Pikes, Halberts, Partiſans, and other long Staves, theſe were divided in three great Batallions, each of twenty thouſand; on the right hand ſtood one of them, on the left hand the ſecond, and the third in the middle. There were about ſix or ſeven thouſand Harquebuſiers on foot, to attend each of theſe great Batallions of Pikes, who were to have ſeveral little Intervals thorough which theſe Harquebuſiers were to ſalley and fire inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the grand Batallions, till they ſhould be neceſſitated to retire through theſe ſame Intervals to the Reer, and then the Pikes were immediately to cloſe and fill up thoſe void places. Theſe three great Batallions ſeparated one from
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:97406:146"/> another, made two great Intervals, in each of which ſtood fifteen thouſand Horſe. Here then you ſee upon the matter, one of the braveſt Armies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that ever was marſhal'd in one front without reſerve (only ſome thouſands of men were order'd to guard the Baggage and Munitions) ſcarce read of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or ſince. Here you ſee the Pikemen make the Wings, whereas both before and ſince they made the Body: Here you ſee the Firemen marſhal'd behind, and ordain'd to fally from their ſtation, and do their ſervice in the Van, and then to retire to their place according to the cuſtom of the ancient <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cian</hi> and <hi>Roman Velites,</hi> and not marſhal'd on the wings of the Pikes.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And here you ſee the Horſe, who before that time and ſince made the wings of an army, make now the Body of it, ſtrongly flanked with Pikes; this being the inverſion of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ordinances of War, was then thought neceſſary to prevent the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the impetuoſity of the <hi>Turks</hi> numerous Cavalry.</p>
                  <p>Armies for moſt part now are marſhal'd in two diſtinct Bodies, the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, and the Arreer-guard, which are commonly called Battel and Reſerve. But it is not only difficult, but purely impoſſible for any the moſt experienced General, to ſet down any one certain rule or order, whereby he may conſtantly<note place="margin">Battel and Reſerve.</note> keep one manner of marſhalling, or one form of Battel, as it is called <hi>forma aciei,</hi> though he could be aſſur'd that his Regiments or Brigades of both Horſe and Foot, ſhould conſtantly continue of one ſtrength, ſince the place, ſituation, Houſes, Villages, Caſtles, Hills, Valleys, riſing heights, hollow grounds, Waters, Woods, Buſhes, Trees, and Marſhes, do occaſion ſuch alterations as make the form or mould of an Army caſt in one place, change ſo much, as you ſhall not know the face of it on another piece of ground, perhaps not above one or two hours march from the former. And in this, as I ſaid before, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is to act his part, and take ſuch advantages as he may, and readily poſſeſs himſelf of ſuch places, which being in the enemies power might do him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. One of his great cares in Embatteling would be to ſecure both his<note place="margin">Flanks of an Army to be well ſecur'd in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>attel.</note> flanks, which are called the right and left hand of his Army with ſome River, Brook, Ditch, Dike, or Retrenchment, if theſe cannot be ſo readily got, then he may do it with the Waggons or Baggage of his Army; for in time of-Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel it is almoſt impoſſible for a Batallion or Body either of Horſe or Foot to ſtand when it is charg'd both in front and flank, and this is ordinarily done by overwinging, ſo that the ſtrongeſt in number hath the advantage, which the weaker ſhould endeavour to counterballance by art, policy, and ſtratagem.</p>
                  <p>This makes me wonder how <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, a great Warrior, in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to his Son <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, aſſerts that thirty thouſand Foot, and<note place="margin">Numbers a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage if they be well order'd.</note> four thouſand Horſe is a ſufficient Army againſt any enemy how ſtrong ſoever, provided it be ſtill kept at that ſtrength, and freſh men put in their places, who are either put in Garriſons, or are kill'd or dead; becauſe, ſaith he, hardly ſhall you find any ground capable to contain more without encumbrances. But him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf found ground to marſhal one hundred and ten thouſand men at <hi>Vienna,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ront; and if he find ground to marſhal theſe thirty four thouſand men, certainly it will be neceſſary to have a Reſerve of twenty thouſand. And aſſuredly greater numbers have the advantage of ſmaller, if they be well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to ſecond one another, whether the ground be ſpacious or narrow, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves being rightly placed.</p>
                  <p>Many are of opinion, and it is grounded on reaſon enough, that Horſe and Foot fight beſt together, but they differ in the way, for ſome would have one<note place="margin">Horſe and Foot toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> Regiment of Horſe, with two Regiments of Foot, or if the Cavalry be ſo ſtrong, a Regiment of Horſe for every Regiment of Foot, and marſhal'd alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately; as firſt, a Regiment of Horſe, and then one of Foot, and ſo with the reſt. Others like not this ſo well, but like better to fortifie their Squadrons with Plottons of Muſqueteers, who give their Vollies inceſſantly, before the<note place="margin">Plottons of Muſqueteers with Horſe.</note> Horſe come to their Charge, and this aſſuredly doth exceedingly diſorder and damnifie Bodies of Horſe before they can come to make uſe of their Piſtol or Lance, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or the Lance is not yet out of faſhion with the <hi>Polonians, Hungarians, Trarſylvanians,</hi> and <hi>Walachians,</hi> beſides thoſe of more Eaſterly Nations. Of this manner of mixing Foot with Horſe, <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> made good uſe in his Wars with <hi>Pole,</hi> and in <hi>Germany</hi> too, eſpecially at the Battel of <hi>Leipſick.</hi> But that great Prince was not the firſt that invented it, it was uſed in the world
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:97406:146"/> many ages before him among the ancient <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cians, Romans,</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> too as I have already ſhewn you. <hi>Coligni</hi> the famous Admiral of <hi>France</hi> had ordinarily Harquebuſiers of Foot mixt with his Horſemen; and truly as I think, Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers have done, and can do good ſervice againſt Horſe before they come to the Charge, ſo I conceive in the Charge, Pikemen well arm'd for the defenſive, would notably aſſiſt Horſemen if they were interlin'd with them. But it ſeems Generals think not ſo, becauſe they do not uſe it.</p>
                  <p>But in the marſhalling Armies there is great difference of opinions concerning the Intervals between the greater Bodies, whether theſe be Regiments or Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades. Some allow but 24 foot of ground between them, and they ſay if they be greater, the enemy may eaſily get into theſe void places, and ſo fall upon<note place="margin">Narrow In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween great Bodies,</note> the flanks of the ſeveral Bodies and ruin them, a conſideration that carries much reaſon with it. But truly this order is good if the Army be drawn up in one front, without any Reſerve. But if it have a Reſerve theſe narrow Intervals in the Battel render it uſeleſs, nay they may help to ruin it. My reaſon is this, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve is appointed to advance againſt an enemy, at one of theſe three occaſions, which are when the Battel is weary, when it is in danger, and when it is beaten. Now in none of theſe three can the Reſerve be ſteedable if there be not ground for it to advance, to draw up, and to fight, but who can imagin that a Brigade of three hundred men in front, in the reſerve, can advance, draw up, and fight on a ſpot of ground twenty four foot broad, or yet on a plot of ground three<note place="margin">Obſtructs help from the Reſerve.</note> hundred foot broad, for there they ſhould only have ground to ſtand on, but no room to handle their arms, eſpecially their Muſquets. But it will be yet worſe if the Brigades of the Battel be flying, and theſe of the Reſerve advanceing, for there ſhall be in that caſe ſuch a medley, and an Embarras, that they ſhall ruin one another without the help of an enemy.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe for theſe or the like reaſons, others allow as much Interval between two Brigades marſhal'd in the Battel as can contain a Brigade drawn up behind it<note place="margin">Large Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of better uſe.</note> in the Reſerve, all the Brigades being ſuppoſed to be of a like ſtrength and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. And thereby whether the Battel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eel, faint, or fly, the Reſerve may come up to the ſhock with an enemy, without any empeachment given to it by the flying Brigades of the Battel, and thereby a fair opportunity given to thoſe who fled or retir'd, to rally on the ground whereon the Reſerve ſtood, which was the order the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> kept in their three Batallions of <hi>Haſtati, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes,</hi> and <hi>Triarii,</hi> as I have at length ſhewn you in my Diſcourſes of their Art of War.

Now what better way is there to rectifie this evil, than not to draw up any Batallion of the Reſerve directly behind a Batallion of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, but in a direct line behind the Interval that is between two Batalions of the Battel; and this is the <hi>Romans</hi> way, who drew up the three Bodies of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Legions one behind another, Chequerwiſe.</p>

                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:97406:147"/> who commanded the Reſerve, commanding him to advance inſtantly to his ſuccour, but he made no great haſte: the <hi>Swede</hi> having obtain'd the Victory, <hi>Vizthumb</hi> next morning is queſtion'd for his ſlow advance, he juſtified himſelf by making it appear, that if he had advanc'd immediately, thoſe who were running away in Troops would have routed him, at leaſt have ſo diſorder'd him, that he could have done no ſervice, and therefore he ſtood firm in his firſt ground, till all the runnaways were paſt him, and then march'd up in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Moſt of this was known to be true, but if Battel and Reſerve had been marſhal'd in the manner I ſpoke laſt of, there had been no danger of that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Vizthumb</hi> was afraid, for there had been room enough for him to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, and for thoſe who fled, to have run away. But it ſeems it was order'd otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>But we ſhall marſhal an Army both ways, firſt with the leſſer, and next with the greater Intervals; and we ſhall ſuppoſe our Army to conſiſt of ſixteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand<note place="margin">Army of 16200 Horſe and Foot, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Brigades of Foot, and ſix of Horſe,</note> Horſe and Foot, and a few more. We ſhall draw them up in a fair Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign or Heath, which hath very few or no encumbrances of Houſes, Trees, heights, or hollow places, and the right hand of it ſhall be fenced with ſome unfordable water, and the left with the Waggons of the Army. The Army it ſelf ſhall conſiſt of ſeven Brigades of Foot, and ſix of Horſe. Each Brigade of Foot ſhall conſiſt of 1800 men, in all 12600. The ſix Brigades of Horſe ſhall conſiſt of 3600, which being divided into ſix parts, gives 600 Horſemen beſides Officers, to every Brigade; in all 16200. In the firſt way of marſhalling, I ſhall allow as I ſhould do, one foot of ground for every Foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſoldier to ſtand on, and three foot diſtance between files; but becauſe ſome think this too much, have patience, and at my ſecond marſhalling of the army, I ſhall allow them leſs, though no leſs belongs to them. To every Horſeman I allow four foot of ground for himſelf, and the diſtance between him and his ſidemen. Some will think it too much, but <hi>Bockler</hi> allows him ſix, this is too much; at next marſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I ſhall allow him leſs than four.</p>
                  <p>On the right wing of the Van guard or Battel, ſhall ſtand two Brigades of Horſe, and on the left wing as many, and between the wings the Body ſhall be<note place="margin">Marſhal'd in Battel and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve with leſſer Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals.</note> compoſed of four Brigades of Foot. On the right wing of the Reer-guard or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſhall ſtand one Brigade of Horſe, and on the left wing another Brigade of Horſe, and between the two wings the Body ſhall be compoſed of three Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades of Foot. The length of the Battel you may compute thus, every Brigade of Horſe being ſix hundred, and drawn up three deep, conſiſts of two hundred Leaders, for each of theſe, four foot are allowed, that is eight hundred. Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply eight hundred by four, (which is the number of the Brigades of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel) the product is 3200. Three Streets or Diſtances each of eight foot-broad muſt be allow'd in every Brigade, <hi>inde</hi> twelve Streets in four Brigades, theſe make 96 foot, then you have two Intervals on the right hand, one between the two Brigades of Horſe, and another between the Horſe and the right hand of the Foot, and as many you have on the left hand of the Battel, in all four great<note place="margin">The Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Battel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.</note> Intervals, each of them of 24 foot, for more ſome will not allow, <hi>inde</hi> 96 foot; add 3200 to 96, and both to 96, you will find the aggregate to be 3392. And ſo much ground doth the four Brigades of Horſe poſſeſs with their Intervals. Each Brigade of Foot conſiſting of 1800 men, being ſix deep, hath 300 Leaders, theſe poſſeſs 1200 foot, 1200 being multiplied by four (which is the number of the Foot-brigades of the Battel) produceth 4800. There muſt be a diſtance of ſix foot between the right hand of the Pikemen, and the right wing of the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers, and another on the left hand, theſe two Diſtances take 12 foot, and therefore four Brigades require 48 foot. Now four Brigades have three Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, each of 24 foot, <hi>inde</hi> 72. Add then 72 for greater Intervals to 48 allow'd for leſſer Diſtances, the aggregate is 120; add 120 to 4800, the aggregate is 4920: ſo much ground doth four Brigades of Foot poſſeſs with their Intervals. Be pleaſed to add 4920 to the 3392 Foot, which the four Brigades of Horſe poſſeſt, you will find the aggregate to be 8312 foot, which being divided by five to make paces, the Quotient is 1662, and two foot; ſo much ground do our four Brigades of foot and four Brigades of Horſe take up in front, the Intervals between Brigades being allowed to be no greater than 24 foot. According to this allowance the Reader may eaſily calculate the longitude of the three Brigades of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:97406:147"/> Foot, and two Brigades of Horſe, which make the Reer-guard or Reſerve, if he conceive it worthy of his pains.</p>
                  <p>To marſhal our Army of 16200 men another way, in order to Intervals, I ſhall in the firſt place allow no more ground to either Foot-ſoldier or Horſeman<note place="margin">Marſhal'd in Battel, and Reſerve with greater Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals.</note> for himſelf, and diſtance from his ſidemen, but three foot in all. But for the great Interval between two Brigades, I ſhall allow as much ground as a Brigade may ſtand on, that the Brigade in the Reſerve may poſſeſs it when order'd to advance. You will remember we agreed that four Brigades of Foot, and four of Horſe ſhould make the Battel, and three Brigades of Foot, and two of Horſe ſhould make the Reſerve; which I marſhal thus, On the right hand of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel two Brigades of Horſe, but between them an Interval of as much ground as one of the Brigades poſſeſſeth. On the left hand of the ſecond Brigade of Horſe, an Interval of 24 foot, on the left hand whereof four Brigades of Foot marſhal'd in one front; theſe four muſt have three Intervals, each of them capable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Brigade of Foot, on the left hand of them an Interval of 24 foot, and then two Brigades of Horſe with ſuch a diſtance between them as that the two Brigades on the right wing had. The Reſerve I marſhal thus, One Brigade of Horſe drawn up at a convenient diſtance directly behind the Interval between the two Brigades of Horſe on the right wing of the Battel. Then on its left hand, three Brigades of Foot drawn up directly behind the three Intervals ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be between the four Brigades in the Battel, and on their left hand, the ſecond Brigade of Horſe drawn up behind the Interval appointed to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Brigades of Horſe, which makes the left wing of the Battel.</p>
                  <p>The Longitude of the Battel marſhal'd as I have ſaid, you may compute thus,<note place="margin">Longitude of the Battel computed.</note> The two Brigades of Horſe on the right wing, each conſiſting of 600 Horſe, and conſequently of 200 Leaders, both of them 400 Leaders, each whereof hath three foot of ground allow'd him, require 1200 foot, and the Interval 600, the diſtance between them and the Foot 24, as much you are to allow to the left wing of the Horſe, add theſe together, you will find the aggregate to be 3648. Each Brigade of Foot conſiſting of 1800 men ſix deep, hath 300 Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſo the four Brigades have 1200 Leaders, each of theſe hath three foot allow'd him, <hi>inde</hi> 3600 foot, ſo every Brigade hath 900 foot of ground, as much muſt every Interval have, now there be three Intervals, and three times 900 amounts to 2700. There muſt be in every Brigade two Intervals, each of ſix foot between the Pikes and Muſqueteers, ſo 12 foot in every one, and in all the four 48. Add 48 to 2700, and both of them to 3600, the aggregate is 6348. So much ground is requir'd for the Foot of the Battel. Add 6348 to 3648, which was allowed to the Horſe, the aggregate will be 9996, which will want four foot of two <hi>Italian</hi> miles. I ſhall neither trouble my Reader nor my ſelf to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Longitude of the Reſerve. What I have ſaid of two ways of Marſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Army of 16200 Horſe and Foot, is meant only in order to Intervals, for it is moſt certain, an Army may be drawn up in as many ſeveral figures and forms as there may be Generals to ſucceed one another in the command of it.</p>
                  <p>Between the Battel and Reſerve there ſhould be as great diſtance of ground as a Brigade of Foot poſſeſſeth in its Longitude; but if the Army be marſhalled in three bodies, then the diſtance between Battel and Reer-guard muſt be double, that diſtance that is between Van-guard and Battel, that there be room for both to rally, this was obſerv'd by two late Princes of <hi>Orange, Maurice</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> in drawing up their Armies, following therein the practice of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in their Intervals between their <hi>Haſtati, Principes,</hi> and <hi>Triarii.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> Of the Women, and Baggage belonging to an Army, of the General Waggon-maſter, and of his Duties.</head>
                  <p>OUR levied men being arm'd, paid, exerciſed, diſciplin'd, divided into Troops, Companies, Regiments and Brigades, with Officers belonging to them, and ſufficiently proyided with General Officers, and a Train of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, and at length marſhal'd in order of Battel, are now ready to march, but I am afraid, the Baggage will diſturb them, unleſs it be put in ſome order.</p>
                  <p>The great number of Coaches, Waggons, Carts, and Horſes loaded with baggage, the needleſs numbers of Women and Boys who follow Armies, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a march, ſlow, uneaſie and troubleſome. And therefore the <hi>Latins</hi> gave<note place="margin">Baggage juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedimenta.</hi>
                     </note> baggage the right name of <hi>Impedimenta,</hi> hinderances. But becauſe without ſome baggage an Army cannot ſubſiſt, it would be his eare who commands in chief to order the matter ſo that the baggage may be as inconſiderable and ſmall as may be, and that it march in ſuch order that every Waggon-man, Carter and Baggage-man may know his own place, that ſo they may neither diſturb one another, nor yet hinder the march of the Army. The place where the Baggage ſhould march is appointed according to the knowledg the General hath of his enemy, if he be in the Reer, the Baggage ſhould be ſent before the Army; if he be in the Van, it ſhould be in the Reer. But in theſe places there ſhould be<note place="margin">Baggage ſhould have Convoys of Horſe and Foot.</note> with it a Convoy of Horſe and Foot, ſtrong or weak, according as occaſion ſeems to require. And of Convoys for Baggage I ſhall ſay theſe few things in general: In them theſe Horſemen who are not very well mounted, may well enough be employed, but no men are to be ſet there, whether of Foot or Horſe, that are ſick, lame, or wounded, for that were to betray both them and the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to an enemy. When Convoys are put to fight for defence of their Charge, as many times they are, (for the deſire of booty ſpurs men to deſperate attempts) they ſhould (if conveniently they can) caſt themſelves within the Waggons and Carts drawn up round for that purpoſe, from whence Muſqueteers may do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſervice, and out of which retrenchment the Horſe may as they ſee occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, make handſome Sallies. If they cannot get this done, they ſhould be ſure to put as much of the Baggage, or all of it, if they may, between them and their own Army, and themſelves between the Baggage and the enemy, whether he fall out to be in the Van, or in the Reer. Sometimes if the danger appear to be both before and behind, the Baggage marches in the middle of the Infantry, and though ſome be of the opinion, that the Baggage ſhould ſtill follow the Artillery, yet that doth not, nor cannot hold in all caſes and emergencies, the marching of both Armies and Baggage many times depending on contingents, of which no determinate rule can be given.</p>
                  <p>The way to regulate Baggage is to appoint under a ſevere penalty that no Company, Troop or Regiment ſhall have more Waggons, Carts, or Baggage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> horſes than ſuch a ſet number already order'd by the Prince, or his General,<note place="margin">The number of Waggons, Carts and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage-Horſes ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</note> which ſhould be as few as may be, with full power to the Waggon-maſter Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to make all that is over that number, prize, with an abſolute command to all Colonels to aſſiſt him in caſe of oppoſition. In the former Diſcourſes we have ſeen that the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> to free themſelves as much as was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of this great Embarras of Baggage, loaded their Soldiers like Mules and Aſſes; this perhaps did ſuit thoſe times, better than it would do ours. But moſt of our Modern allowances for Carriages of an Armies Baggage hath been in the other extream. I ſhall inſtance four.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Swediſh</hi> Kings and their Generals allow ten Waggons to every Troop of Horſe, and two to every Company of Foot, and a Sutlers Waggon to every one
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:97406:148"/> of them, ſometimes two to a Troop of Horſe, beſides the Waggons allowed to<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Swediſh</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of Waggons.</note> the field and Staff-officers of Regiments. Let us then ſuppoſe that the Cavalry of an Army conſiſts of five thouſand Horſe, and theſe divided into a hundred Troops, and fifty Horſe in a Troop were thought fair in the <hi>German</hi> War. Theſe hundred Troops had for themſelves a thouſand Waggons, and a hundred for their Sutlers. Model theſe hundred Troops in twelve Regiments, and allow for every Regiment ſtaff eight Waggons, you are to have ninety ſix Waggons more, add theſe ninety ſix to the other eleven hundred, the Waggons of your Cavalry (beſides Coaches) amount to eleven hundred ninety ſix. Let there be an Infantry of nine thouſand men join'd to this Cavalry, let it be divided into fifteen Regiments, and each Regiment into eight Companies, there will be a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty Companies, for every Company two Waggons are allowed, and one for the Sutler, theſe are three for a Company, <hi>inde</hi> for a hundred and twenty Companies three hundred and ſixty Waggons; for the Staff of every Regiment allow eight Waggons, <hi>inde</hi> for fifteen Regiments a hundred and twenty Waggons, add a hundred and twenty to three hundred and ſixty, you have four hundred and eighty Waggons for the Infantry, beſides Coaches. Add 480 to 1196, the Waggons of the Cavalry, the total of Waggons for both amounts to 1676, you may ſafely allow to the general perſons of this Army at leaſt a 120 Coaches and Waggons, and then you have 1796; beſides all theſe numbers of Waggons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> belonging to the Train of Artillery, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viant, I have ſeen in a <hi>German</hi> Army that exceeded not 6000 Horſe and Foot, not ſo few as 900 Waggons.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond inſtance ſhall be of the <hi>Dane,</hi> and ſome <hi>German</hi> Princes, whoſe<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dane</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
                     </note> allowance is ſomewhat leſs than the <hi>Swedes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third of the Emperour, who allows more Waggons to both Horſe and<note place="margin">Emperours.</note> Foot than the <hi>Swede</hi> doth, and that is needleſs.</p>
                  <p>My fourth Inſtance ſhall be of the <hi>French</hi> allowance, not of our times, but<note place="margin">
                        <hi>French</hi> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes fifty years ago,</note> Fifty years ago, for four of the Genſd'arms Baggage a Waggon was appointed; <hi>inde</hi> 25 Waggons for 100 men at Arms. The light armed were allowed no Waggons, but were appointed to carry their ſtuff on Horſeback; and how many Horſes were allowed them for that uſe, I find it not ſpecified; but we may make a conjecture, when we ſee how many were allowed to the Foot: In the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, who died about ſixty years ago, one Horſe was allowed to carry the Baggage of four Souldiers: hence we may conclude, that a horſe was allowed for the Baggage of two Light-horſemen, or of Archers; ſo for Infantry of 10000 men, beſides Officers, 2500 Baggage horſes were allowed. Beſides, a Gudget or Boy was allowed to ſerve two Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <hi>inde</hi> for 10000 Souldiers, 5000 Gudgets, the very Vermine of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Theſe horſes and Boys, did, no doubt, very unneceſſarily deſtroy both Proviant and Fodderage. And yet <hi>Louis de Montgomery</hi> in his <hi>Milice Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coiſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Much retren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</note> approves of this allowance. But the <hi>French,</hi> now, of all other people puts the greateſt reſtraint on their Baggage: And indeed, it <hi>Montgomery</hi> had liv'd till my time, I could have let him ſee one hundred <hi>French</hi> Souldiers, whoſe Baggage (except the Clothes on their backs) might all have been carried in a<note place="margin">A Souldier may carry his own luggage.</note> Handkerchief. And though I joyn freely with him in his opinion, that the Souldiers ſhould not carry ſuch burthens as the <hi>Romans</hi> did of old, yet I would have neither Horſe nor Boy allowed to them; It is too much, that the bad Cuſtom of later times, hath eas'd moſt of them of the burthen of defenſive arms, and therefore every one of them both may, and ſhould carry his own Knap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack and four or five days proviſion of meat; with a Hatchet at his girdle, which laſt I ſee too much neglected, on this ſide of the Sea: in ſo much as where an Infantry comes to encamp, if it be for one night, or two, or more, the Souldiers muſt make uſe of their Swords, for cutting down branches of Trees, and to cleave Wood, either for making their Huts, or for fire; indeed I know not for what moſt of their Swords ſerve, being for moſt part ſo extreamly baſe, yet aſſuredly Hatchets were more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for thoſe uſes, I have ſpoke of, than their Ammunition blades, which<note place="margin">Allowance of Boys to ſerve Soldiers out of uſe,</note> can hardly cut any thing. But ſuch an allowance of Boys and Horſes, were in faſhion in <hi>France,</hi> long before <hi>Louis de Montgomery's</hi> time: for I find ſome in Records of the Civil Wars, the Proteſtants did retrench theſe allowances,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:97406:149"/> when their Souldiers were Garriſon'd; for then it is ſaid, four of them had but one Gudget allow'd them to wait on them, and a whole company of them, were but allow'd ſix horſes for their Baggage, and indeed I think both theſe were too many for them in the field, in Garriſon they needed none of them. Though you allow every Souldier two pound of Bread and Cheeſe every day, and God knows, he gets not ſo much many times in four days: ſuppoſe he hath a couple of Shirts, a pair of Stockins, and a pair of Shoos in his Knapſack,<note place="margin">As not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</note> (and how many Souldiers have all theſe?) and a Hatchet; I ſay, all theſe will not weigh ſo much as a Head-piece, and a Corſlet, and therefore he may well enough be obliged to carry them.</p>
                  <p>Every Regiment, whether of horſe or foot, ſhould have a Waggon or a Baggage-maſter, and where the eſtabliſhment of the Prince doth allow him no pay, the Colonel ſhould order a ſufficient Serjeant or Corporal to exerciſe that Office by turns, theſe are to ſee that every Officers Baggage, from the higheſt to the loweſt, march according to the Dignity and Precedency of him to whom it belongs, whether it be carried on Waggons, Carts, or Horſes. But theſe Regiment Baggage-maſters are not to ſuffer the Baggage of the Regiments to march, till they have received their Directions from the Waggon-maſter Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,<note place="margin">Waggon-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter General,</note> when, and in what manner it ſhall be done. This Waggon-maſter Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's charge is exceeding toylſome, when an Army marcheth. Every night after the Army comes to Quarter, and every morning before it march, he muſt attend the Major Generals of the Cavalry, and Infantry, and receive his Orders from them, if the whole Army march together; but if the Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry march apart, then the Major General of the foot gives the Waggon-maſter<note place="margin">His Toyle.</note> his inſtructions, particularly a liſt, in what order the Army is to march, for ordinarily, Regiments and Brigades change by turns, and their Baggage muſt march<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that ſame order, that themſelves do: the Waggon-maſter having got his liſt, he accordingly orders the Regiment Baggage-maſters (who are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to wait on him every morning) to cauſe their luggage march, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they may not fail; for (unleſs ſome extraordinary occaſion alters it,) the Prince, or in his abſence, the Commander in Chief his Coach, or Coaches, with his Waggons go firſt, then the whole Train of Artillery behind it, the<note place="margin">The order how the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If any Waggons or Baggage-horſes preſs to be before theſe, behind whom the Waggon-maſter General hath ordered them to march, he may ſafely make prize of them, owe them who will. When the Waggons come to a Heath, or a Champaign field, the Waggon-maſter ſhould order the Waggons to draw up two, four, or five in rank, and to drive in that order, ſo long as the ground permits them to do ſo, and this ſaves time, and makes diſpatch, and when they come to ſtrait ground, they are to fall off, by the right hand, in that order wherein they were before. The ſame courſe he is to take with Baggage horſes. This Baggage-maſter General is allowed to have two Lieutenants; ſo that if the Army march three ſeveral ways, (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>IF there be any confuſion in the march of an Army, or that the right order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it be neglected by general perſons in appointing every Regiment or Brigade its own place, with the Train of Artillery and Baggage, or that Colonels, Majors and Captains be careleſs to obey their orders in their march,<note place="margin">A careleſs march the ruin of an Army.</note> and ſuffer their Souldiers to run, ſtraggle, and lag behind, it not only gives an enemy a wiſhed advantage, but is enough of it ſelf to ruin an Army even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of an enemy. In a march an Army may be ſurprized in paſſing a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, whether that be by Foord, Bridg or Boat, or when it marcheth thorough marſh grounds, or cloſe Countries, when it aſcends or deſcends Hills; to all theſe inconveniences a careful General ſhould advert, and according to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence he hath, either he is to advance his march ſpeedily to gain a paſs or advantage of ground, or ſtop his march, and encamp and fortifie, and if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe will help, he ſhould draw up in Battel, either fronting that ſame way as he was marching, or facing about to fight the enemy, whether he be in his front or reer, and let God diſpoſe of the Victory as ſeems good in his eyes.</p>
                  <p>Our Modern Armies have marched, and do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtill march one of three ſeveral<note place="margin">An Army may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>arch in three ſeveral manners:</note> ways, theſe are firſt by dividing an Army into three ſeveral Bodies, Van-guard, Battel, and Arrier-guard; ſecondly, by marching in two diſtinct Bodies, as they uſe to fight, and theſe are commonly called Battel and Reſerve. Thirdly, all in one Battel, whereby is meant the half of the Cavalry in the Van, the other half in the Reer, and the Foot between them. To clear all theſe three ways of marching, let us ſuppoſe our Army to conſiſt of ſix Brigades of Horſe, and eight of Foot. Theſe are divided after the firſt way thus: In the Van-guard<note place="margin">Firſt manner in three Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> three Brigades of Horſe, and out of theſe a ſtrong party of three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe to go before to ſearch the ways, and diſcover. That party ſhould be about one <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile before the three Brigades of Horſe, and out of it ſhould be ſmall parties ſent out about half an <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile, which ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly acquaint the great party, and it the Brigades behind, and ſo from hand<note place="margin">Van-guard.</note> to hand, till the Intelligence of all they learn, comes to the General. After theſe forlorn Troops of Horſe follow commanded Muſqueteers, with Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers to ſmooth and make plain the ways for the Artillery, whether it be by cutting Trees or hedges, or filling hollow grounds or Ditches. After the three Brigades of Horſe follow ſome Field-pieces, ſuppoſe the half of thoſe that are with the Army, and ſome Waggons loaded with Ammunition; immediately after them march two Brigades of Foot, theſe are follow'd by the Baggage of the whole Van-guard, and behind it a commanded party of Horſe and Foot; ſo you ſee this Van-guard is a petty Army of it ſelf. In the next place comes the Battel, in this order: Firſt, two Brigades of Foot, after them the Prince or his<note place="margin">Battel.</note> General in perſon, attended with the Guard of his Body, and Servants; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind theſe the General or Colonel of the Artillery, who is followed by the great Ordnance, and whole Train of Artillery; after it cometh in due order, the Baggage belonging to the General Officers, and to all the four Brigades which compoſe the Battel; in the Reer whereof march two more Brigades of Foot, and theſe ſometimes are brought up by a party of Horſe. After the Battel comes the Reerguard of our Army; and that is the Reverſe of the Van-guard, for firſt<note place="margin">Reer-guard.</note> marcheth its Baggage with a commanded party of Horſe and Foot, next follow two Brigades of Foot, then ſome Field-pieces; behind them, the other three Brigades of Horſe, who have a party behind them at the diſtance at leaſt of one <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile, to give them advertiſement if an enemy be following. And this is the firſt, and a very commendable manner of the march of an Army. But ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to make the greater expedition, eſpecially if an Army be numerous, theſe
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:97406:150"/> three great Bodies may march three ſeveral ways if the Country conveniently<note place="margin">Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Commander in chief marcheth and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dgeth conſtantly with the Body of the Infantry and the Artillery. And theſe great Officers who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Van-guard and Arrier-guard, have Majors attending them every day and night, beſides Ordinance-Horſemen, to receive their Directions, and bring them ſpeedily to them in regard ſome new intelligence may rationally move them to alter the manner of the march, or any Orders they gave concerning it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond manner of the march of an Army is in two Bodies, Battel and<note place="margin">Second man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in two Bodies.</note> Reſerve. You will be pleaſed to remember that the Army we now ſpeak of conſiſts of ſix Brigades of Horſe, and eight of Foot, which I thus order: In the Battel ſhall firſt march 400 commanded Horſe, who ſhall have a ſmaller party before them to diſcover; next them Pioneers or Country people with a party of Muſqueteers or Fire-locks to plain the ways, then four Brigades of Horſe: Next them, Field-pieces, then three Brigades of Foot; after them the Prince, or he who commands by his authority, the General or Colonel of the Artillery follows; after whom comes the great Ordnance, and whole Train, which is followed by the Coaches and Waggons belonging to the General, and all the other General Officers; after them comes the Baggage belonging to all the Brigades of the Battel, in that ſame order that the Brigades themſelves march; after which come two Brigades of Foot, and then a party of Horſe brings up the reer of the Battel.</p>
                  <p>The Reſerve follows in this order: Firſt, a Commanded party of Horſe and<note place="margin">Reſerve.</note> Foot, then the whole Baggage that belongs to the Reſerve; next to it Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces with their Waggons of Ammunition, after them three Brigades of Foot, and then two Brigades of Horſe, about one <hi>Engliſh</hi> mile behind them, follows the Reer-guard of Commanded Horſe. Theſe two great bodies for expedition<note place="margin">Theſe two Bodies may march two ſeveral ways.</note> ſake, may likewiſe march two ſeveral ways, (if the General have no apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an enemy) and join, when he gives order for it. Obſerve when an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is in the reer, the Battel is the Reſerve, and the Reſerve is the Battel, and conſequently more Brigades ſhould be in the Reer than in the Van, and in the Reer at ſuch an occaſion, the Commander in chief of the Army ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>The third manner of an Armies march, is when it neither marcheth in two<note place="margin">Third man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in one Body.</note> nor three diſtinct Bodies, but in one intire Body, which is frequently practiſed; let me then once more refreſh your memory by telling you our Army conſiſts of ſix Brigades of Horſe, and eight of Foot. Three Brigades of Horſe march firſt, and make the Van-guard, theſe have before them commanded Horſe, Pioneers, and Muſqueteers as the others had. Then follow four Brigades of Foot, the General after them, next him the General of the Artillery, with his whole Train, after it marcheth the other four Brigades of Foot, and theſe eight Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades of Foot compoſe the Battel of the Army; the other three Brigades of Horſe make the Reer-guard, behind which at a miles diſtance follows a ſtrong party of commanded Horſe. The Baggage may be in the Van, or the Reer, or<note place="margin">May be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeveral Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> if the General apprehe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d danger in them both, it may march immediately after the Train. This great Body may be very ſoon divided into either two or three ſeveral ones, and may march as many ſeveral ways as the General pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>But truly with ſubmiſſion to great Commanders I ſhould be of opinion, that the Baggage of an Army ſhould never be divided, unleſs the Army it ſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides: if danger be in the Van, let it all ſtay in the Reer, the proper place of Baggage; if the enemy be expected in the Reer, poſt away all the Baggage to<note place="margin">The proper place of Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a march.</note> the, Van; if in both, neceſſity will force it to be in the middle of the Army. But my humble opinion is, that without apparent danger it ſhould conſtantly be in the Reer of the whole Army, for the diſadvantage is but ſmall that the Brigades or Regiments of the Van have (and withal they have but their turns of it) that they muſt wait very long at night till their Baggage come from the Reer: It is
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:97406:151"/> but ſmall, I ſay, if you compare it with the great prejudice the Prince or States ſervice ſuffers, by having the Regiments or Brigades which march in the Reer benighted, being hinder'd by the Baggage that is order'd to march before them, two, three, ſometimes five hours, whereas if that Baggage had not been in their way, they might have reach'd their Quarter ſeaſonably enough. But there is a worſe thing in it than that, when upon the unexpected appearance of an enemy in the Van, the Brigades that are in the Reer-guard being ſuddenly call'd up, they are not able <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> advance for the unavoidable Embarras of Baggage that is before them. Indeed I think the middle or center of the Infantry a proper place for the great Guns, and Train, and the Generals Secretaries, and Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets with his Papers, and for moſt of his, and ſome of the other General Officers Coaches, eſpecially if their Ladies be in them, and there I think theſe ſhould conſtantly march. But my judgment is, that all other Baggage whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to either Horſe or Foot ſhould be in the Reer, according to that priority or precedency the Regiments or Brigades have themſelves in the march, and theſe ſhould change every day, that who is in the Van one day, may be in the Reer the next, that all may participate equally of the eaſe or toil of a march.<note place="margin">Where the ſick and wounded ſhould be.</note> What is ſpoke of the place where Baggage ſhould march, is to be underſtood alſo of the ſick and wounded Soldiers, who if they cannot be put in ſome ſecure or fortified place, ſhould be brought forward, though Baggage-horſes ſhould be borrowed from the owners for that uſe, and in time of danger ſhould be ſent as far from it, as may be with a good Guard or Convoy.</p>
                  <p>When ground will permit the Brigades of an Army, whether Horſe or Foot to march in one breaſt or front, there is a queſtion, what diſtance or interval ſhould be kept between theſe Brigades. There be ſome, who theoretically ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that the diſtance between two Brigades, (both marching in breaſt, but the one behind the other) ſhould be of as much ground, as a Brigade drawn<note place="margin">Diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades on a march, ſhould not be ſo great as when they are to fight.</note> up in front doth poſſeſs; becauſe, ſay they, when one Brigade is drawn up on the right hand of a large field, where the whole Army is to be marſhal'd, the ſecond Brigade which follows, cannot draw up in full breaſt on the left hand of the firſt, unleſs there be ſuch an Interval between them on their march, as that I juſt now told you of; nor can the third draw up on the left hand of the ſecond, unleſs it have that ſame diſtance: the like is to be ſaid of all the reſt. To this I anſwer, when an Army is marſhal'd in Battel-order, that diſtance is to be kept between Brigades, whereof I ſpoke in the laſt Chapter, and ſo the ſecond will have the leſs difficulty to marſhal it ſelf on the left hand of the firſt: But that cannot make me allow ſo much ground between Brigades on a march, as I willingly do, when they are to fight. To the reaſon produced againſt it, I ſay, to think that a Brigade, all in one breaſt, and marching directly behind ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (though at never ſo great a diſtance) can draw up in breaſt on the left<note place="margin">The contrary opinion exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd.</note> hand of another, without ſome turning, or wheeling, is a meer ſpeculation. And I ſay more, let a Brigade march in three Squads, at as great a diſtance as you will, the ſecond ſhall not draw up on the left hand of the firſt, without ſome wheeling. And if a ſmaller body cannot do it, much leſs can a greater. And practice will ſhew the vanity of the other opinion, to any who will be at the pains to examine it, and obſerve it in the march of Brigades in the field, as I have done oftner than once. This opinion then vaniſheth, unleſs they who follow it, bring a better reaſon for it, which I have not yet heard. But be pleaſed to take notice, what an inconvenience, and that no ſmall one, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this rule will bring along with it in a march (I ſpeak ſtill when Brigades march all in one front, one behind another) at that rate there ſhall be ſuch avaſt diſtance between the Van and the Reer, that the laſt Brigade, ſhall not get up (though it run, which it ſhould not do) to the place where it ſhould be marſhal'd, but in a very long time, which you will eaſily grant to be true, if you will with me make this computation: We have ſpoke of eight Brigades of foot in this Chapter, to be in our Army, each of them ſhall be no ſtronger than 1800 men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore each of them muſt be 300 in front, allowing four foot to every Leader; theſe 300 Leaders poſſeſs in rank 1200 foot of ground, as much (by this opinion which I combate) muſt be allowed for an Interval between two Brigades marching one after another, in breaſt; now in eight Brigades there are ſeven Intervals, ſeven times 1200 foot make 8400: Every one of the Brigades poſſeſs in deepneſs
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:97406:151"/> 36 foot, multiply 36 by 8 (which is the number of the Brigades) the product is 288. Add 288 to 8400, the aggregate is 8688 foot; ſo much diſtance there is from the Leaders of the firſt Brigade of Foot, to the Bringers-up of the eight and laſt. Take a view of our ſix Brigades of Horſe, each whereof ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt<note place="margin">And found inconvenient.</note> of no more than 600, being three deep, each Brigade hath 200 in front, allow but three foot for every Rider, the front of each Brigade poſſeſſeth 600 foot of ground; as much muſt every Interval between Brigades have: now in ſix Brigades there are 5 Intervals, 5 times 600 make 3000, allow for three ranks and two Intervals in every Brigade marching in breaſt, 36 foot, and multiply 36 by 6 (which is the number of the Brigades) the product is 216; add 216 to 3000, the aggregate is 3216 add that to 8688, the aggregate is 11904; divide this number by 5, to make paces, the Quotient will be 2380 paces and four foot, this will be two <hi>Italian</hi> miles, and more than one third<note place="margin">An intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſtance.</note> between the firſt rank of the Cavalry, and the laſt rank of it; the Infantry marching in the middle, a thing intollerable, that there ſhould be ſo vaſt a diſtance between the Front and Reer of an Army of 18000 Horſe and Foot, marching in Brigades, and every Brigade marching in breaſt, and neither piece of Ordnance, Waggon or Baggage-horſe among them.</p>
                  <p>And this leads me to another ſpeculation, which is, that all who have the conduct of Armies, ſhould in a march allow as little Interval between either greater or ſmaller Bodies, as poſſible may be, in regard, Woods, Waters, Paſſes, cloſe Countries, Straits, and narrow ways, will make a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between the Vans, and Reers of their Armies, than is in their power<note place="margin">Diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Van and Reer of an Army marching.</note> to make leſs. To verifie which, let us ſuppoſe with <hi>Bockler,</hi> a late <hi>German</hi> Author, that 10000 Foot and 1000 Horſe are upon a march, where the Foot may march ten in breaſt, and the Horſe five; and have only ten half Cannon, with Powder and Bullets for one day, and only ſome neceſſary Baggage with them; he paſſeth his word, to us, that this little Army when it is marching ſhall take up of ground between Van and Reer 28000 foot; this is more than five <hi>Italian</hi> miles, and one half. I have a little examined the computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I believe his reckoning to be right.</p>
                  <p>But, if you pleaſe, let us not truſt his word, but try our ſelves, what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance there may be between the Van of an Army, conſiſting of 15000 Foot, and 3000 Horſe, with which ſhall be no more Ordnance than ten Demi-cannon;<note place="margin">Inſtanced in an Army of 18000 men.</note> and twenty Field-pieces; and a leſs Train, if any, you cannot allow to an Army of 18000 fighting men. And with this Army we ſhall ſuffer no more Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons to be than 1200 for carrying all the Ammunition, Inſtruments for Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Artillery, Proviant and Baggage belonging to the General Officers, and the whole Horſe and Foot, whereas twice that number may be well enough allowed; and to make the diſtance the leſs, we ſhall allow but two horſes for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Waggon, without having any regard to Coaches, or great Ruſt-Waggons (drawn ordinarily by ſix horſes,) whereof there be but too many in every Army. Let us imagin we march not in a Champaign, but in a cloſe Country, yet not ſo cloſe, but the Horſe ſhall march five in breaſt, and the Foot ten, and there be many ways, which will not permit ſo much; and to ſpare ground, I ſhall allow no Intervals between Regiments or Brigades of Foot, only Intervals between Diviſions ſhall be allowed, and no Interval at all between either Regiments or Diviſions of the Cavalry ſhall be allowed, but the whole 3000 ſhall march five in breaſt all in one row.</p>
                  <p>The Foot being ſix deep, and ten in front, will march 60 men in each Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.<note place="margin">15000 Foot marching ten in front or breaſt.</note> We muſt ſee how many ſuch Diviſions will be in 15000 men. To know this, divide 15000 by 60, the Quotient will be 250, ſo you have 250 diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; allow, as you muſt, 36 foot for the 6 ranks of every Diviſion, that is 6 foot for the ranks to ſtand on, and 30 foot for the 5 Intervals; therefore you muſt multiply 250 by 36 (which is the number of your Diviſions) and the product will be 9000. For an Interval between two Diviſions I ſhall only allow 12 foot, whereas many allow 18; now there be 249 Intervals, multiply therefore 249 by 12, the product is 2988. Add 2988 to 9000, the aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate is 11988: And ſo many foot of ground muſt 15000 Foot have from Van to Reer, when they march ten in breaſt.</p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:97406:152"/>
                  <p>Being our 3000 Horſe are to march five in breaſt, you are to divide 3000<note place="margin">3000 horſe marching five in Breaſt.</note> by 5, and the Quotient will be 600, ſo you have 600 ranks, we muſt allow every Rider ten foot for the length of his Horſe, multiply then 600 by 10, the Product is 6000. Ordinarily a Horſes length is allow'd for an Interval between ranks of Horſe; but becauſe we would march cloſe, we ſhall allow but the half of that, to wit, five foot: now there be in 600 ranks 599 Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, multiply then 599 by 5, the Product will be 2995. Add 2995 to 6000, the aggregate is 8995, ſo many foot of ground 3000 Horſe take up in their marching five in breaſt.</p>
                  <p>We have ten Demi-cannon which ſhoot each of them a bullet of 24 pound at leaſt, each of them ſhall weigh no more but 4400 pound of metal, though the <hi>Germans</hi> allow more than 5000. Allow then one Horſe to draw 250 pound of this Piece, you ſhall need 18 Horſes at leaſt to draw one Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cannon, with her Carriage, Leaver, Sponge and Laddle, theſe 18 Horſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Ten Demi-Cannon drawn one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</note> coupled, make nine couple; allow then for nine couple of Horſes, for the length of the Piece and her Carriage 110 foot, and it will be little enough: multiply then 110 by 10 (which is the number of your Demi-cannon) the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is 1100, ſo much ground they muſt have when they are drawn one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, and here is no allowance for diſtance between them, nor ſhall we give any between the 20 Field-pieces, but ſhall allow each of them to be drawn by two Horſes, nor ſhall we give more ground to the Horſes, Piece<note place="margin">And twenty Field-pieces.</note> and Carriage than 20 foot, that is for all the twenty 400 foot.</p>
                  <p>Our 1200 Waggons will take up much ground, nor is it poſſible to help it. Nor can we allow leſs ground for a Waggon drawn with two Horſes, and a convenient diſtance between it and the Waggon which follows it, than<note place="margin">1200 Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons drawn one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</note> 22 foot, multiply then 1200 by 22, the Product will be 26400, ſo much ground require twelve hundred Waggons when they are drawn one after another.</p>
                  <p>The Foot then require 11988 foot, the Horſe 8995, the Demi-cannon 1100, the Field-pieces 400, the Wagons 26400, add theſe numbers together, the aggregate will be 48883. Theſe make in paces 9776, and three foot, about nine <hi>Italian</hi> miles, and three quarters. If you ſuſpect I have caſt up a wrong account, be pleaſed to work your ſelf, and mend it at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>By this you may ſee if the Army be ſtronger than this of ours, as many be, or the Train greater, as indeed it ſhould be, or your Waggons more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as aſſuredly they will be, or the way narrower, as for moſt part it chanceth to be: you may ſee, I ſay, how many miles may be between your Front and your Reer. And indeed, though the Train of Artillery, by the ſticking of great Guns and Pot-pieces in deep, dirty, or clay ground, give no retardment to the march, as frequently it doth; or that an Army meet with no extraordinary encumbrances, as happily it may: yet it will be no marvel to ſee the Van at the head quarter, before the Reer-guard be march'd out of their laſt nights Leaguer, though the march be fourteen or fifteen <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles long, and therefore there is good reaſon to allow as little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or Interval between ſeveral bodies or batallions as may be, and to<note place="margin">A cloſe march the beſt, and ſecureſt.</note> divide an Army into two, three or more bodies, and march ſeveral ways to make the greater expedition, when it may be done ſafely, and without danger of an enemy, and if he be in your Reer, and that you intend not to fight, dividing, ſo you keep good order, facilitates your Retreat.</p>
                  <p>The two Princes of <hi>Orange, Maurice</hi> and <hi>Henry,</hi> both of them excellent Captains, order'd that in a march, when one Regiment was divided into two great Partitions, there ſhould be no more but fifty foot of diſtance between them, and only eighty foot between one Regiment and another. Theſe Princes cauſed their Armies to march (according to ancient cuſtom) in three great Bodies, Van guard, Battel, and Reer-guard, and thoſe they called <hi>Tercias,</hi> or <hi>Terſos,</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> word which ſignifies <hi>Thirds,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Spaniards</hi> called their Regiments of old, and for any thing I know they do ſo ſtill. Theſe <hi>Terſos</hi> of the Princes of <hi>Orange</hi> were indeed grand Brigades, and theſe had Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rs, who were call'd Majors of the Brigades beſides Majors of Regiments.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:97406:152"/> And in a march the Princes allowed no greater diſtance between theſe great bodies, but an hundred, or a hundred and twenty foot at moſt. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they did not quadrate with the opinion of ſome of our modern Captains, who will have as great a diſtance between Brigades as the longitude of a Brigade is, which we may ſuppoſe to be very many times a thouſand foot, though ſometimes leſs; and conſequently if there be ten ſuch Brigades of Foot, the very nine Intervals between the ten Brigades takes up nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot, near two <hi>Italian</hi> miles, and therefore if the way be not very broad, there will be ſeveral miles between the Van and the Reer of the Infantry; but the reaſons brought by thoſe that are of this judgment may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to be but weak by a viſible practice.</p>
                  <p>When an Army is to go over a Paſs, a Water, or a Bridg, the whole<note place="margin">To march over a Paſs, or a Strait,</note> Bodies of it ſhould be order'd to march very cloſe, loſing ſomething of their ordinary diſtances, that one Brigade or Batallion being paſt, another may immediately follow without intermiſſion. Captain <hi>Rud</hi> the late Kings Engineer, a very worthy perſon, ſays at the paſſing a ſtrait an Army ſhould make an halt, and draw up in battel, and then paſs over ſo many in breaſt as the place will permit, and when they are all over, draw up again before<note place="margin">And not loſe time.</note> they march. For the laſt part I ſhall agree with him, for no ſooner ſhould any Forlorn-hope, Troop, Company, or Regiment be over a Paſs, but they ſhould draw up in Battel till ſome others be over, and if there be not ground enough, they ſhould advance by little and little, till they find a more ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous field, where they may draw up in breaſt, and expect the reſt; or if he mean that every particular Regiment or Brigade ſhould draw on that ſide of the ſtrait which it is to paſs, till the Reer of that Regiment or Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade come up, and then begin their march over: I ſhall yet agree with him, but for a Van of an Army to ſtay till the Reer come up, before it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to paſs a ſtrait, is a great loſs of time, which in the march of an Army is very precious; for in an Army but of an indifferent ſtrength, that halt ſhall be the ſpace of at leaſt four hours, and this furniſheth an opportunity to an enemy to oppoſe the paſſage, or wait his advantages on the other ſide of the ſtrait, with more force, policy, and deliberation.</p>

                  <p>THE day is far ſpent, and the Army hath march'd far, Quarter muſt be made ſomewhere, and it muſt be either in Towns, Villages, or the fields. If the Army be diſperſed in ſeveral Villages or Hamlets, it is done that it may<note place="margin">To Quarter in Villages.</note> be refreſhed for ſome ſhort time, and when there is no danger of an enemy. If it be to lodg for one night, and an enemy is near, then both Horſe and Foot ſtand in the field all night, with ſtrong Guards, Forlorn-hopes, Rounds, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovilles. If an enemy be not near, ordinarily the Head quarter is in ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Town or Village, and the Cavalry quarter'd round about in Hamlets; the Infantry is encamped cloſe by the Head-quarter, and if it be but to ſtay a night or two, it doth not uſually Entrench, but as the old <hi>Grecians</hi> did, Encamps on ſome place ſomething fortified by nature, as on a hill, or ſome defenſible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, or where a river may be on one hand, and a marſh on the other, and where the place i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Or if the Foot muſt lodg in a Champagn, their Waggons<note place="margin">To Quarter in the Field.</note> drawn about them will be an excellent good ſhelter againſt ſudden Infalls, and this the <hi>Germans</hi> call a <hi>Wagonburg,</hi> that is a Fortification of Waggons; and it is better than the <hi>Roman Foſſa Tumultuaria,</hi> in ancient times. Where ever this Night-leaguer chanceth to be, he who commands in chief, muſt be careful to chuſe ſuch a place as wants for neither wood, water nor foderage. An Alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place ſhould be appointed for the Horſe, in caſe their Quarters happen to be beat up in the night, as alſo a place of Rendezvouz, at which the whole Army is to meet next day, (if it be all in one Body) and at ſuch an hour as the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſhall appoint.</p>
                  <p>The Encamping of an Army for ſome conſiderable time requires an orderly<note place="margin">To Encamp, and fortifie for a long time.</note> Caſtrametation and Fortification, and though it be not very ordinary, yet it hath been, and may be occaſion'd by ſeveral accidents and emergements, ſuch as theſe: When an enemy comes unexpectedly, whoſe ſtrength and deſigns are not known; when a Prince or his General thinks it not fit to hazard a Battel;<note place="margin">Reaſons for it.</note> when he would preſerve the Country behind him, whether it belong to the Prince himſelf, or to his friends, or that he hath won it from his enemy. When the Peſtilence or other contagious Diſeaſes rageth ſo in Towns and Villages that he dares not hazard to quarter his Army in them. When he ſuppoſeth he may deſtroy his enemy by temporizing, as <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> who uſed to ſubdue his enemy more with hunger than the ſword. Or as <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſays, The greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of a General is to gain the victory without blood: Or when <hi>ratio belli,</hi> and ſometimes, <hi>ratio ſtatus,</hi> makes him ſtay for more of his own forces, or thoſe of his friends and allies. This oblig'd the Great <hi>Guſtavus</hi> to fortifie his Leaguers, and his Armies within them at <hi>Verben,</hi> and at <hi>Nuremburg.</hi> Or laſtly, when he is to beſiege a Town, Fort, or Caſtle, which he conceives will not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoon render, and may rationally expect ſuccours and relief.</p>
                  <p>Being then there are ſo many, and may be more reaſons for a fortified<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Louis de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomerie</hi>'s diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation anſwered.</note> Leagure, I cannot agree with <hi>Louis de Montgomerie,</hi> who will only allow of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched Camps in two caſes, when an Army is near a conſiderable enemy, and when other lodging cannot be had. And he alledgeth that the <hi>Roman</hi> Camps and their <hi>Hiberna,</hi> and ſome of our fortified Leaguers would be only good in <hi>Arabia</hi> the Deſert, but not in a Country where Towns, Villages, and Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations may be had. But beſides the reaſons I have given for Entrenched Camps, I ſhall ſay to <hi>Montgomerie,</hi> that it is not improbable but many of theſe places
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:97406:153"/> where the <hi>Romans</hi> kept both their Winter and Summer Quarters were then as Deſert as <hi>Arabia</hi> is now; and in our time it is ordinary to take in Villages, Hamlets and Caſtles within the circuit of a fortified Camp; or if a fortified Town be either behind, or on the flank of a Camp, it adds infinitely to the ſtrength and conveniences of it, provided there be no contagion or infectious diſeaſes within tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Town.</p>
                  <p>But let us ſuppoſe that which often falls out, that a Leaguer is to be planted in an open field, where no Town or Village is, and then let us ſee, how an Army can be conveniently quarter'd in it, that it be ſo capacious as to contain all is ordain'd to be within it; and next that there be no part or place of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant or uſeleſs, in regard it muſt be fortified, and the ſmaller circumference a fortification is of, the more tenible and defenſible it is, and the fewer men will maintain it. But before a Prince or his General form his Camp, he ſhould be obſervant of ſuch conſiderations as theſe which follow: Firſt, if he can chuſe,<note place="margin">Some Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Entren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching a Camp.</note> he ſhould not Encamp in low grounds, for theſe are unwholſome of themſelves, and will quickly be made worſe. Next, if he Encamp on a hill, it ſhould be ſuch a one as hath a river, or water running by the foot of it, and ſuch a water whoſe ſtream cannot be diverted by the enemy; for a river or deep running water doth not only ſerve the neceſſities of the Camp, but defends ſome ſide or part of it. Thirdly, he ſhould be ſure that his enemy have no fortified place or Garriſon on the ſide or flank of his Camp, much leſs behind it, which may cut off the paſſes and avenues, whereby his Proviſions ſhould come. Fourthly, he ſhould Encamp in ſuch a place where his Horſe may not want fodder, and where abundance of Hay, Straw, or growing Corn may be had, both to feed the Beaſts, and for the Soldiers to cover their Huts with, and to lye upon. Fifthly, if Woods be not near him, he ſhould lay down a way how wood may be brought to him abundantly, for fire to the Guards, for dreſſing meat, for baking and waſhing, for the uſe of the Artillery, for Palliſado's, Batteries, Platforms and Bridges. But obſerve that if a great and thick Wood be contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as much of it as lyeth within ſeven or eight hundred foot of the Camp ſhould be cut down, and two or three Sconces or Redoubts built where the Trees ſtood, for preventing ambuſhes, or ſudden eruptions of an enemy. And after the Camp is planted and entrenched, the Commander in chief would or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<note place="margin">Magazines for Proviſions.</note> ſtrong Convoys both of Horſe and Foot, for bringing all manner of Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, Proviſions, and Munitions to his Camp from theſe places where he hath appointed Magazines to be kept; as alſo he ſhould appoint Guards to Convoy the empty Carts, Waggons, and Horſes back again, and cauſe his Souldiers to uſe the Country people kindly and well, and not ſuffer them to be outraged any manner of way, that thereby they may be encouraged to return the oftner.</p>
                  <p>The defence of the Camp conſiſts in two things, the firſt is its fortification,<note place="margin">Defence of a Camp.</note> the draught whereof is the work of the Engineer, by encloſing it within and without the Ditch with Bulwarks, Curtains, Redoubts, Sconces, half moons, and Tenailles, all which go under the General name of Trenches, which word is only proper for the Fortification of a Leaguer, and but borrowed for the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to beſieged places. The ſecond Defence of the Leaguer conſiſts in its Guards, and of theſe I ſhall ſpeak in the next Chapter. The ſubject of this is the orderly diſpoſing and giving a due proportion of ground to every Regiment, Troop and Company of Horſe and Foot, whereon to pitch their Tents, or<note place="margin">What Caſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metation is.</note> build their Huts, to the Generals Tents, to all the General Officers, to the Train of Artillery, for the Proviant-maſter and Proviant, to the Waggon-maſter and Waggons, and finally to all that belong to the Army, from the higheſt to the loweſt; and this is called <hi>Caſtrametation,</hi> a <hi>Latin</hi> word which ſignifieth the Meaſuring the Camp, for the ground muſt be proportionably given out by an equal meaſure, and the doing it is the proper work of the Quarter-maſter General.</p>
                  <p>This Officer knowing the Generals pleaſure, is to give the ſeveral Regiments<note place="margin">A Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</note> and Brigades their Towns, Villages and Hamlets for their Quarters; nor muſt any of them offer to take any other than thoſe that are aſſign'd to them by him, and therefore when the Army is to be quarter'd, though but for one night, the Regiment Quarter-maſters of the whole Army are bound to wait upon him and receive his directions; and if they be to Encamp in ſuch a Leaguer as that we
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:97406:154"/> now ſpeak of, it is he who meaſures out to every Regiment its proportion of ground, as ſhall be preſently declared. It is he likewiſe who hath the inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the old Fortifications, and the directing new ones, and for this reaſon the Engineers are properly under him, but he is to ſee the working and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Fortifications. He hath frequently a Lieutenant or D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>puty under<note place="margin">His Office and Duties.</note> him. His Office is very honourable, for by it he ſits in all Courts and Councils of War. He ſhould be an underſtanding perſon, and a good Mathematician. The oldeſt Colonel of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army uſed to be General Quarter-maſter, but that cuſtom is worn out long ago.</p>
                  <p>The Quarter-maſter of the General Staff is only needful at the Headquarter,<note place="margin">Quarter-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the General Staff.</note> and when he knows from the Quarter-maſter General, where that is, he goes thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the force Troops, and makes the Billets ready, chooſing out the beſt houſes for the General, and then divides the reſt among the general Officers, according to the quality of the charges they have; This Officer hath often a liſt (ſign'd by the General) of the names of many others beſides General Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, who are to be lodged at the Headquarter, and theſe are often Colonels of foot, but more commonly ſome reformed Officers, Colonels, Lieutenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, and Majors, and others alſo, who have ſerved the State or Prince before, and wait on the Commander in Chief for imployment. But many times, it falls out, that there are not houſes at the Headquarter to ſerve the half of the General Officers; and in that caſe, this Officer is to divide all the Barns, Stables, Yards, Encloſures, and Hedges, as equally and proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, as he can, for in quartering, no man hath power to appropriate a piece of ground to himſelf. In ſuch a Camp as we are now to deſcribe, this Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter divides the ground given by the General Quartermaſter to the General Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers according to that length and Breadth, that is allotted to every one of them, and that is more or leſs according as the perſon is of higher or lower quality.</p>
                  <p>The greater an Army is, the ſtricter and better order it ſhould keep in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping; for unleſs it be well looked to, multitudes breed confuſion. Thoſe numerous Armies we read of under the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchs, had no doubt the Art of encamping; but much more, I think, are we obliged to believe, that <hi>Moſes, Joſhuah,</hi> and other Great Captains of the Iſraelites, in<note place="margin">The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> excellent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrametators <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> their forty years wanderings in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Wilderneſs, had the art of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrametation in its perfection, which I conceive was derived either by written directions or Tradition, from one Generation of that people to another, and ſo made the quartering of thoſe vaſt Armies we read of in holy writ led out to Battel by the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> eaſie to them. <hi>Tamberlan</hi> that famous <hi>Tartarian</hi> King is much commended for the excellent order he kept, and the rules he gave both for the march and Encamping that numerous Army of his conſiſting of a Million of men. And I doubt not but the <hi>Turk</hi> hath very good<note place="margin">So are the <hi>Turke.</hi>
                     </note> Conſtitutions for the regular Caſtrametation of thoſe multitudes of men, which uſually he leads after him. But though ſome undertake to deſcribe both his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick and Military Government, yet they give us but a very general intelligence of the laſt, whatever they may ſeem to do concerning the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Whether the Great <hi>Cyrus</hi> Encamped his Army as <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſays he did; and if he did ſo, whether he had learned it from the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> or the <hi>Perſians,</hi> or invented it himſelf, matters not much: it is enough that it is univerſally thought to be excellent, and in the Modern Wars prefer'd to the <hi>Roman</hi> Caſtrametation. The manner of his Encamping (as that Author informs us) was ſhortly this: He<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cyrus</hi> his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping,</note> lodged himſelf in the midſt of his Army, and in the Center of it; about him were the Guards of his perſon, and his Engines of War, ſuch as Tortoiſes, Rams, and the like, as alſo his Magazine. Without theſe were his Horſemen, and about them lodged his light armed Foot, as Slingers, Darters, and Archers, and without all theſe quarter'd his heavy-armed Foot, who ſerved for a wall (ſays our Author) to the reſt of his Army, though no doubt he had a retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (when neceſſary) without them.</p>

                  <p>But before the Quarter-maſter General begin to meaſure out the Camp, it will be fitting that the General by Trumpet and Drum make his pleaſure<note place="margin">Some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations from the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</note> known in theſe particulars: That none preſume to come near the Quarter-maſter General, while he is doing his Duty, but Quarter-maſters, Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, and a few to ſerve them, leſt by a multitude of ſpectators and gazers, he and thoſe with him be diſturbed in the exerciſe of their charges. That none offer to pull up, take away, or remove any ſtaves or marks that are planted or fixt for deſignation of Quarters, Huts, or Tents. That no Officer or Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier preſume to take any more, or any other ground than that which is allotted to him by the Caſtrametator. That no Turff be caſt up within the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence<note place="margin">Muſt preceed the caſtrame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> of the Camp, for ſpoiling it, eſpecially in rainy weather.

All theſe things ſhould be intimated, or what elſe the preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of place, time, accidents, or emergences may require.</p>
                  <p>The Quarter-maſter General ſhould have Liſts given him of the numbers of every Regiment, Troop or Company both of Horſe and Foot; and becauſe all Regiments are not alike ſtrong of Companies, nor all Companies alike ſtrong<note place="margin">Liſts muſt be given to the general Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-maſter.</note> of men, the Rolls muſt mention how many Troops and Companies are in each Regiment. and how many men in each Company. A Liſt muſt be given him by the Quarter-maſter of the General Staff, how many General Officers are to be lodged about the General; he muſt have Rolls of all the Perſons, Guns, great and ſmall, and Waggons belonging to the Ordnance. The like he muſt have from the Proviant Office. The Waggon-maſter General muſt give him a Liſt of thoſe Waggons which cannot conveniently quarter beſides the Regiments to<note place="margin">And from whom.</note> whom they belong, but he muſt not add to that number that is allowed by the eſtabliſhment of the Prince or State to whom the Army doth belong.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve that the Quarter-maſter General after he hath got all theſe Liſts, draws a platform of the figure of the whole Camp on paper, and ſhews it to the General of the Army, and it being approv'd by him, the Quarter-maſter goes about his work. Obſerve next, that there muſt be no meaſures in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my but conform to thoſe of the Quarter-maſter General, whether theſe be feet, roods, toiſes, or fathoms. Obſerve thirdly, that the length of all the Quarters of the General, General Officers, Train, Proviant, Waggons, Regiments, Troops or Companies muſt be equal and uniform, and this longitude is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Caſtrametator with the Generals conſent in this Camp of ours, the length of all Quarters ſhall be, if you pleaſe, three hundred foot. Obſerve<note place="margin">Obſervations neceſſary for regular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping.</note> fourthly, that the latitude or breadth of particular Quarters, is unequal, for a Quarter is broader or narrower according to the ſtrength or weakneſs of the Troop or Company that is to lodg in it. By this you will ſee that all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Quarters of the whole Camp will be quadrangular, but not at all aequilate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, for ſome of them are longer than they are broad, but in moſt the breadth exceedeth the length, ſo you may conclude them all to be of an oblong figure. Fifthly obſerve, that all Quarter-maſters ſhould come provided with four long Staves or Poles, which are to be plac'd at the four corners of that oblong qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangle ordain'd for that Quarter, theſe four Poles ſhould have ſome Colours, Flag or Enſign upon them, whereby it may be known for whom that Quarter is appointed.

                        </gap>rige Aures,</hi> Reader, obſerve what I have ſaid before, and take heed to what I ſhall ſay hereafter, and I hope you ſhall find it eaſie.</p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:97406:155"/>
                  <p>All theſe things, whereof I have ſpoken, being prepar'd, which need not take ſo much time as I have ſpent in writing them; the Quartermaſter General meaſures out to the Quartermaſter of the Staff, the Generals Quarter, in the very middle and center of the Camp; and the ground that ſome would have allotted for it, ſeems to be more than needs, that is 300 foot in length, and 600 in breadth. This is very much, and four times and one half more than the <hi>Romans</hi> allowed to their Conſuls <hi>Praetorium,</hi> which was two hundred foot ſquare, and ſo contained within its circumference 40000 foot, and that was eight <hi>Italian</hi> miles. But if you will know how much ground is within the quarter<note place="margin">Quarter for the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</note> of our modern General, you are to multiply the length of it by its breadth, that is 600 by 300, work and you will find the product to be 180000 foot, that is 36000 paces, 36 <hi>Italian</hi> miles. It is too much for any General, below a Soveraign Prince, or one of his blood: And therefore I think out of this may be taken a <hi>Forum,</hi> or Market-place, and a quarter for Volunteers or Strangers, and the General will ſtill keep enough. However a Generals quarter ſhould be very large, for he needs much ground for his Dining-room, Bedcham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Anti-chamber, a Hall for his Council of War to ſit in, Rooms for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-Domo, his Gentlemen, Pages, Lacquies, Butlers, Cooks, Maſter and Grooms of his horſes, for his Proviſions, for Kitchens, Cellars, and Stables, for all his Serving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and waiters; as alſo two places for thoſe who wait for Orders, or attend diſpatches, one covered, the other uncovered. But few of our Generals keep ſuch a Port, unleſs they be Princes. This quarter ſhould have a Ditch about it, with a Drawbridge, and a ſtrong Guard kept at it.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, the Caſtrametator meaſures out to the Quartermaſter of<note place="margin">For the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Staff.</note> the Staff, a quadrangle of ground, within the Circumference of which are to lodge all theſe General Officers, whom I have mentioned all over theſe Diſcourſes, and therefore I ſhall not need to name them here; all of them may be quarter'd according to their places and dignities, in a place of 300 foot long, and 400 foot broad; multiply the one by the other, you will find the contents of it to be 120000 foot, and that is 24 <hi>Italian</hi> miles, which is ground enough.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner hath the Caſtrametator ſeen four ſtaves prick'd at the four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the aſſigned quarter, but he leaves the particular lodgings to be divided (yet ſtill according to his direction) to the Quartermaſter of the Staff, and goes with the Quartermaſter of the Train, to whom he meaſures out a Quarter for the General of the Ordnance, which ſhall be 300 foot long,<note place="margin">For the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Ordnance.</note> and 50 broad, multiply the one by the other, the Content is 15000 foot, 3 <hi>Italian</hi> miles, in which may be lodged, beſides himſelf, ſuch of his Officers as he ſhall think fit. But in lodging the Train it ſhould be conſidered, that ſeveral Guns with neceſſary Ammunition, are often left behind at needful places, and many of them muſt be planted on the Bulwarks, and Curtains of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Camp, the reſt will require the leſs ground; and therefore the General hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already got his Quarter, all the reſt of the Officers and others belonging to the Train, whatever name, Title, and Office they may bear (whom I particularly nam'd in my diſcourſe of the Train of Artillery) the place for the Magazine of<note place="margin">For the whole Officers, Guns and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Train.</note> Arms and Ammunition for all the pieces of Ordnance to ſtand on, and an empty place where Waggons may be loaded and unloaded, and for ſome Streets, each of them twenty foot broad: for all theſe I ſay, it will be enough to allow a quadran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of 300 foot long and 500 broad; for if you multiply the one by the other, you will find the content of this quarter (beſide that of the Maſter of the Ordnance) to be 150000 foot, <hi>inde 30 Italian</hi> miles. If this be true, as probably it is, <hi>Achilles Terduzzi</hi> is much miſtaken, to require for a Train of Artillery belonging to an Army Royal, (which himſelf will have to conſiſt of 18000 Foot and 6000 Horſe) the fourth part of the whole Camp; I do not find, that the Lord <hi>Baſta,</hi> the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Lieutenant General in <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> to whom I conjecture, <hi>Terduzzi</hi> was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Engineer, ever had ſo conſiderable a Train, as required half ſo much ground.</p>
                  <p>To the Proviant-maſter General we ſhall allow a Quarter 300 foot long, and<note place="margin">For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viant-maſter General.</note> 60 broad; the one being multiplied by the other, produceth 18000 foot, ſome more than three <hi>Italian</hi> miles, and one half. This will be enough for him and all his Officers and Baggage, and for a large place for disburthening of Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons: for you ſhould conſider that all Proviſions are brought to the Camp either by Country Carts, Horſes and Waggons, and theſe return ſo ſoon as they are
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:97406:155"/> unloaded; or by the Horſes belonging to the Baggage and Sutlers of the Army, and theſe preſently return to their Maſters, and the Proviant it ſelf is inſtantly given out and diſtributed to the Army.</p>
                  <p>As to the Waggons it is to be conſider'd that all of them that belong to the General Officers and the Train, may get room enough at the ſeveral Quarters, and ſo may moſt of thoſe that belong to the Regiments of Horſe and Foot, but<note place="margin">For the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon-maſter General and 600 Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons.</note> upon all adventures the Quarter-maſter General ſhall appoint a place for 600 Waggons, and the Waggon maſter General and his Lieutenants, and for this uſe he ſhall allow no leſs ground than 300 foot in length, and 512 in breadth for the 600 Waggons, and 300 foot in length, and ten in breadth for the Waggon maſter and all his Officers; this laſt quarter makes 3000 foot, more than one half of an <hi>Italian</hi> mile. To underſtand the quarter allowed for 600 Waggons, obſerve firſt, that we allow no more Horſes for every Waggon than two, with a Waggoner and a Boy. Secondly, every Waggon muſt have 12 foot of ground to ſtand on in length, and ſix in breadth, and every Horſe four foot in breadth, and eight in length; for I will not allow ſo much length for a Baggage-horſe, as for a horſe for ſervice, which is ordinarily reckon'd ten. Thirdly obſerve, that both the Waggons and Wagg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe grounds being laid down, fifty Waggons may ſtand by their bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Over againſt them fifty Waggons more, all in one row likewiſe, ſo a hundred Waggons are quarter'd for their breadth, which is the Camps length; for the length every Waggon hath twelve foot, ſo the two rows have 24 foot, and between them a ſtreet of twelve foot, and behind one of them another empty place of twelve foot for fodder, and the Waggon men to lye, though theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily lye either in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or under the Waggons, theſe two ſtreets having allowance of 24 foot, and the two rows of Waggons 24 foot likewiſe, the quarter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for a 100 Waggons takes up 48 foot of the breadth of the Camp; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply 48 by 6, becauſe you have 600 Waggons, the Product will be 288, this ground 600 Waggons muſt have for their breadth; for their length is the ſame with all the quarters of the Camp, that is 300 foot. We have now 1200 VVag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon-horſes<note place="margin">For 1200 Waggon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſes.</note> to quarter, and that muſt be beſides the Waggons; you know we allow four foot for the breadth of the Horſe, and therefore in 300 foot, you may quarter 75 Horſe, for 4 times 75 make 300. Over againſt theſe 75 more in one row, theſe make 150. Behind the one of the two rows an empty place for fodder, 6 foot broad, between the two rows a ſtreet 6 foot broad, the two ſtreets have 12 foot in breadth, and the two rows of Horſes have 16, that is 8 foot for every row, (and you remember 8 foot are allowed for the length of a Baggage-horſe) 12 being added to 16, make 28, ſo many foot do two rows of Horſes with two ſtreets take up of the breadth of the Camp; and in theſe two rows are contain'd 150 VVaggon-horſes, whoſe whole number are 1200, 8 times 150. Multiply then 28 by 8, the Product is 224 foot, and ſo much ground do theſe 1200 VVaggon-horſes take up of the breadth. Be pleaſed to add theſe 224 foot to the 288, which is allowed to the VVaggons, the aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate will be 512, which we allowed for the breadth of the Quarter meaſured out to 600 VVaggons, and 1200 VVaggon-horſes, the length allow'd is the ſame of all other quarters 300 foot. Multiply 512 by 300, the Product is 153600, ſome more than thirty <hi>Italian</hi> miles, and one half, in the ſuperficial mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>Our Caſtrametator hath left the VVaggon-maſter General to divide pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably that allotted ground among his VVaggons, and is gone to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Cavalry, but he finds unequal Liſts, therefore he muſt be at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er trouble to give to every Regiment ground according to its ſtrength; for as I ſaid before, all Regiments (even thoſe under one Prince) are not of equal<note place="margin">Quarter for the Cavalry.</note> number of Troops, nor all Troops of equal number of men. But here we ſhall ſuppoſe we are to Encamp a Regiment of eight Troops, and every Troop to conſiſt of a hundred Riders, comprehending in that number the Corporals and Trumpeters; you will remember that the breadth of the Horſe is meaſur'd by
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:97406:156"/> the length of the quarter, and his length by the breadth of it. Obſerve ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ten foot are allowed for the length of a Horſe, and four for his breadth. Obſerve thirdly, that we allow to every Rider ten foot for the breadth, and four for the length of his Hut. But I hope the Horſeman will not be ſo caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to think his Horſe and he are laid in equal ballance, becauſe they have a like proportion of ground allow'd them, for if I cannot make a differen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A Troop then of a 100 Horſes is quarter'd in two ſeveral rows, 50 in a row, ſide for ſide, which fifty Horſes take up for their breadth; and of the length of the quarter 200 foot, to wit, four for every horſe. The length of every horſe hath 10 foot, every Riders Hut hath 10 foot, that and a Street between them 5 foot broad, make 25 foot, the other row of horſe and riders take up the like quantity of ground, to wit, 25 foot, theſe added together make 50 foot.<note place="margin">Quarter for a Troop of one hundred Horſe.</note> The horſes ſtand tail to tail (becauſe their heads muſt be to their Maſters huts) and between the horſes tails there is a Street 20 foot broad; add theſe 20 to the other 50, the aggregate is 70, and that is the breadth of a quarter allotted to a Troop of a 100 horſe. As to the length of this quarter, it is as the reſt 300 foot, whereof I told you the breadth of 50 horſes took up 200. The other 100 is thus divided, The Ritmaſter hath 20 foot of it for the length of his Tent or Hut, the Lieutenant hath 10, and the Cornet hath 10, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the Troopers Huts there is a Street 20 foot broad, theſe make 60 foot; in the length at the reer of the Troopers Huts, there is a Street 20 foot broad, and that 20 added to 60 make 80; behind that Street the Saddler, Smith, and Sutler have a quarter 10 foot in length, which being added to 80, make 90; behind them there is a place for fires, and dreſſing meat, 10 foot long, that being added to 90 makes 100 and ſo the length of a quarter for an 100 horſe is 300, and the breadth 70, multiply the one by the other, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct will be 2100 foot, which is the ſuperficial meaſure of that quarter. But obſerve that the Ritmaſter quartering in the front takes up with his Hut all the 70 foot; the Lieutenant and Cornet behind him ſhare that breadth between them, and accommodates likewiſe the Quarter-maſter, and him who aſſiſts the Cornet to carry the Standard, whom the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>San Junckher,</hi> the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Standard, or Colours.</p>
                  <p>Having lodged one Troop, it is eaſie to quarter a Regiment, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a whole Cavalry. I told you our Regiment of horſe ſhould conſiſt of 8 Troops, and every Troop of 100 Horſemen; if one Troop then require 70 foot in breadth, 8 muſt require 8 times 70, multiply then 70 by 8, the Product is 560. Some allow no more ground to a Colonel of horſe than to a Ritmaſter, there may be reaſon for it, if he quarter on the head of his own Troop, as ordinarily<note place="margin">For the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel, and his Staff.</note> Colonels did when they had but the temporary command of 3 or 5 Troops, but now that he is abſolute Colonel of 8 Troops, we allow his Captain Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant to quarter on the head of the Troop, and we give to the Colonel and his Field and Staff Officers a Street of 70 foot broad, and 300 long; which I thus divide, The Colonel ſhall have all the 70 in breadth, and 40 in length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, the Street 20 foot broad, which traverſeth the whole Regiment, then there ſhall be 200 foot in length, and ſtill 70 in breadth, for all his Field and Staff Officers, and for Stables and Waggons. In the reer of theſe that Street which traverſeth the reer of all the Horſemens Huts; behind that a plot of ground 10 foot long for Saddlers, Smiths, and Sutlers belonging to the Staff; and behind that 10 foot are allowed for Kitchins and fire, add th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now the 8 Troops, and the quarter for the Colonel and his Staff, being all of equal length and breadth, muſt have 8 Intervals, for every one of which muſt be allowed 20 foot of breadth; ſo for all the eight 160 foot.

                  <p>The Caſtrametator hath now leiſure to meaſure out ground to the Infantry, and he finds the ſame difficulty as he did in the Cavalry, that is, the inequality of the Companies in each Regiment, and the numbers of men in each Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But having done his buſineſs on paper at home, he will eaſily give to each<note place="margin">Quarter for the Infantry.</note> Regiment Quarter-maſter his due proportion of ground in the Field. But ſince all along in theſe Diſcourſes, I have ſpoke of a Foot-regiment conſiſting of ten Companies, and of a Company conſiſting of a hundred men, we ſhall in this place quarter them according to that number. And firſt we ſhall lodg a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany according to the pattern whereof the reſt ſhall be ſoon accommodated. In the number of the hundred I comprehend Caporal, Lanceſpeſatas, Appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Gentlemen of the Company, and common Souldiers. Thoſe who ſhall be quarter'd as Officers, are Captain, Lieutenant, Enſign-bearer, two Serjeants, Clerk, Fourier, Furer of the Colours, Captain of Arms, and two Drummers, for theſe laſt are almoſt univerſally enroll'd with the Officers, I know not why.</p>

Add theſe together, you will find that theſe four, Serjeant, Fourier, Clerk, and Drummer have 25 foot allow'd for their Huts in length, and 8 for the breadth, as all the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have. Behind the oldeſt Drummer in that ſame row are 50 huts for 50 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, for each whereof are allowed three foot and one half.

Over againſt the oldeſt Serjeant, in a parallel line, and directly under the Enſign, is the ſecond Serjeant lodged; below him the Captain of Arms, under him the Furer, and below the Furer the ſecond Tambour, and under him the other fifty huts for the other fifty Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers all in one row; all theſe having a proportion of ground allowed equal to the firſt row on the right hand. In the reer of the Souldiers huts there muſt be a Street 20 foot broad for Waggons and Carts to paſs and repaſs, and this Street traverſeth the whole breadth of both Company and Regiment, as the other of 10 foot doth at the Van of the Inferior Officers huts. Next to this traverſe Street in the reer there is a place for Waggons and Sutlers 10 foot long, and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:97406:157"/> behind that there is another place 10 foot long likewiſe, for fires and dreſſing meat, for there muſt be no fire among the huts, and both theſe places enjoy the full breadth of the Company, which is 24 foot. Be pleaſed then to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that 40 foot in length are allowed for the Captain, 10 for the Lieutenant, 10 for the firſt traverſe Street, 200 for the rows of under Officers and Souldiers huts, 20 for the ſecond traverſe Street, 10 for Sutlers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 10 for fire, add theſe together, the aggregate will be 300, which is the length of the quarter. Remember alſo that 8 foot are allowed for the breadth of all Officers and common Souldiers huts, except the Captains. Then two rows of huts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire 16 foot in breadth, between theſe rows there muſt be a direct Street run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the back of the Captains Tent to the reer, as I told you before, and it is 8 foot broad, add 8 to 16, makes 24, and ſo much ground the Captains<note place="margin">Length and breadth of a Foot compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies quarter.</note> Tents poſſeſſeth, and it is the breadth of the Companies quarter.

Below that Street there ſhall be a plot of ground 40 foot in length, and 64 broad, to be equally divided between the Lieutenant Colonel and Major, if they do not quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beſides their Companies, and behind them a Street 20 foot broad. Below that Street ſhall be a quarter 50 foot long, and 64 broad, to be divided among the Miniſter, Quarter-maſter, Auditor, Secretary, Chirurgeon, and Marſhal; and below them the third Street 20 foot broad. Next to that ſhall be a place 70 foot long, and 64 broad, for Waggons and Baggage; behind that the fourth Street of 20 foot broad, which is at the reer of all the Souldiers huts, and traverſeth the breadth of the whole Regiment. Next to that are the two places formerly mention'd, for Sutlers and fire, one behind the other, each 10 foot long, and 64 broad. If you then remember that the length of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels Lodgings is 50 foot, 10 for a Street, 40 for the Lieutenant Colonel and Major, 20 for a ſecond Street, 50 for the Staff-Officers, and 20 for a third Street, 70 for Waggons, 20 for the fourth Street, and 20 for Sutlers and fires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

As for the time, how long an ordinary Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel ſhould ſtand, whether on Horſe or Foot, I know no reaſon why he ſhould be on that duty longer than one hour, for he may grow either weary or ſleepy, or both, and in that time he would be ſometimes viſited by his Capo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or Lanceſpeſate: And in a rigid froſty winter night, he ſhould not be permitted to ſtand longer than half an hour at one bout. In Garriſons and Fortified Camps, Sentinels of Foot ſhould be provided with Frocks and Hoods,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:97406:159"/> to keep them from rain, ſnow and cold, which every one of them is to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to him who relieves him.

                  <p>The duty of a Sentinel to a Round, ſhould lead me to ſpeak of Rounds; but before Rounds be appointed to go, the Watch muſt be ſet, whereof the Round is an appendix or part.

The time when, the place where, the number how many, and the perſons who ſhould viſit theſe Watches or Guards. A Guard that is vigilant preſerves thoſe who ſleep, and Sentinels are the Guards of that Guard.</p>
                  <p>All theſe four particulars, are abſolutely to be determin'd by him who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in chief, and as his pleaſure ſhould over-rule in them all, ſo time, place, occaſion, emergence, and the pleaſure of the Prince or State whom he ſerves, ſhould over-rule him. To keep too many on Watch, will in a ſhort time ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe who watch, incapable to Watch at all; to keep too few, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth your enemy to attempt that, from which a well order'd and ſufficiently ſtrong Guard would deter him. But by all Souldiers, though there be no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be imagin'd, a Watch ſhould be kept; neither can a command iſſue from a Prince, that can or ſhould hinder an Officer to keep Watch, though their orders may be ſuch, as may render men uncapable both to do the main buſineſs about which they are ſent, and keep any conſiderable Watch, or any Watch at all.

Here they are drawn up according to the antiquity or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency of the Regiments to whom they belong, by either the Major General, or Adjutant General of the Foot. At this Parade ſhould all the Majors of the Foot be, as alſo one Sergeant out of every Company, and moſt of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the whole Army. The Companies being marſhall'd in breaſt, the Major or Adjutant General calls the Majors together, to whom he imparts the ſeveral orders and directions of the General, which may, and very oft doth vary every night, becauſe they depend on emergencies.

And to anticipate that objection which I ſuppoſe will be made againſt my opinion, that Majors are to give to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies<note place="margin">All Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſhould be preſent at a Parade.</note> the orders of the Colonels, as well as of the Major Generals; I ſay, that at Parades, all Colonels, all Field and Commiſſionated Officers ſhould be preſent, for a Parade is the Exchange of Officers, neither ſhould any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cuſe their abſence, but indiſpoſition, or being on preſent duty, and this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent for Officers to do, where-ever the Parade be, whether in Camp or Garriſon; when the Major gives orders to his Sergeants he doth it in the ſame manner as the Major General doth to the Majors, and ſhould have a ring of Musketeers about him, to hinder any to approach or hearken, unleſs they be Commiſſionated Officers of that Regiment, who may be within the ring, and may hear, but ought not to ſpeak, while the Major is diſcourſing to the Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants.

Truly, it is a ſhame to hear, what excuſes I have heard in more places of the World than one, and none more ordinary, than for an Officer to ſay, I was no longer from my Guard than I was taking my Dinner and Supper at my Lodging. If Officers would dine or ſup in their <hi>Corps de guard,</hi> as they are bound to do, Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers would not offer to go home to look for their meat. Officers ſervants ſhould bring their Victuals to them, and Souldiers Wives ſhould carry their Husbands meat to them, if they have Wives, if not, their Comrades ſhould do it.</p>
                  <p>Watches being ſet, they ſhould have Houſes wherein they may ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from rain, ſnow, cold, or exceſſive heat, and fire ſhould be in them, even in Summer, for kindling of Matches: Theſe houſes we ordinarily call Courts of guard, which ſome do not like; but I think they are wrong, for a<note place="margin">

If there be more Regiments than one in a<note place="margin">Who gives the Orders, and how.</note> Garriſon, the Governour either calls all the Majors to him, and gives them the Word and other Orders, or if there be a Town Major, he gives his directions to him, and he imparts them to the reſt of the Majors, and they to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants, in that ſame manner as I told you was done in a Leaguer; thoſe that are on the Watch, and thoſe that are to relieve them, ſtanding all the while in Arms, and in great ſilence. After that, the Town Major divides the whole<note place="margin">To divide the Poſts.</note> Watch into as many parts as there are ſeveral Poſts, and ſends them thither, either by his own command, or by billets: Theſe Poſts are of greater and leſſer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and accordingly have more or fewer men allotted for their defence, and according to the number of the Souldiers, Superiour and Inferiour Officers are appointed to command them, as Captains, Lieutenants, Enſigns, and Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, the Head guards being reſerv'd for Field Officers, unleſs the place be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, and then they may have Poſts aſſign'd them at Ports, Baſtions, Half-Moons, or Horn-works. So ſoon as Guards come to their ſeveral Poſts, the Officers who are to be relieved, ſhew what duty they are to do, and where their night and day Sentinels ſhould ſtand; theſe being reliev'd, the Guard which hath watched, draws up in one body, and either marches or troops (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Governour orders it) if it have Colours, to the place where they lodge; but if it hath had no Colours, it marcheth to their Captain or Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels door, and is there diſmiſs'd.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who viſit the Guards, to ſee whether they and their Sentinels do their<note place="margin">Rounds.</note> duty, are called Rounds. Theſe are ordinarily divided into Grand, and Petty Rounds; nor do I know how to diſcourſe better of both, than to reduce their<note place="margin" type="runSum">Queſtions concerning the Great Round.

Firſt, Whether the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>and Round ſhould give or receive the Word? Many are of the opinion; that though the General himſelf go the Great Round, he ſhould give the word to the Caporal, becauſe under the notion of trying whether all the Caporals of the ſeveral Guards have the Word right, an Enemy giving himſelf out for the Captain of the Watch, may get the Word, to the great prejudice of the Camp or Garriſon. And indeed I find it was conſtantly given to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral by all Rounds fifty or ſixty years ago, but the other cuſtome hath now prevail'd over all, except it be with the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> But the Officer, be he who he will, that goes the Grand Round, being known, there is no danger to give him the Word; and ſo any of the two may be uſed, as it pleaſeth the Prince or his General to appoint. The ſecond queſtion is, Whether the Captain of<note place="margin" type="runSum">Second.</note> the Watch be obliged to go the firſt Round, or if he may ſend Petty Rounds before him, and go the Head round at any hour he pleaſeth, becauſe his main buſineſs being to ſee that all the Guards be preſent on their Poſts, the longer he delays his coming, the better Watch will be kept, his preſence being by them all expected every hour: Yet Cuſtome in many places, obligeth the Great Round to go before mid-night, and to ſend Petty Rounds before him, if he go not the firſt Round himſelf, which he may do if he pleaſe; nay, ſome think he ſhould go the firſt Round; but much of this, without hazard, may be left to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:97406:161"/> his diſcretion, who is Captain or Colonel of the Watch, unleſs he be limited by the General. But if the Governour intend to go the Head Round himſelf, he ſhould acquaint him who commands the Watch with his intention; yet moſt Governours chuſe rather to go Petty Rounds, becauſe ſo they may beſt ſee how Sentinels behave themſelves, and when they come to a <hi>Corps de guard</hi> they give the Word to the Caporal, who knowing him, preſently calls out his whole Guard in Arms, that the Governour may ſee them all preſent; this is a duty which the Governour owes among many others: But I ſhall have a fitter oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſpeak of him in my Diſcourſe of Towns and Forts. The third que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion<note place="margin" type="runSum">Third.</note> is, Whether this Colonel, Governour, or Captain of the Watch, may ride his Great Round, or if he be oblig'd to walk on Foot? It being granted he may ride, (as all Rounds in ancient times did) the fourth queſtion will be,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Fourth.</note> Whether he ſhould receive the Word on Horſe-back, or if he ſhould alight, and either give it, or take it? I think, if he be permitted to ride, I know no reaſon but he may either receive or give the Word on Horſe-back. The fifth queſtion is, Whether the Grand Round be obliged likewiſe to go the laſt Round,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Fifth.</note> which ordinarily is called the Morning Round? and if he do, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> whether he ſhould likewiſe receive the Word? Inded I have ſeen it in ſome places refus'd, and in ſome practis'd; in my judgement, there is no ſhew of reaſon why the Caporal ſhould give the Word to any Round but the Head Round, though the General go it in perſon; for the receiving the Word by the Grand Round from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, is to know, that they have the Word ſo right, that they cannot be cheated with another Word by any of the Petty Rounds; there is neither ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity or conveniency to demand it again from them, and leaſt of all for the Morning Round to ſeek it, for that is the laſt Round, after which it is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whether the Caporal have the Word right or not. Indeed, it is my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that he who commands the Watch in chief, ſhould go more Rounds than the Grand one, and eſpecially the Morning Round, for then is the danger of an Enemies infall moſt to be ſuſpected, but the receiving the Word once from the Caporals is enough in Conſcience, and I think too much. But the Capo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral is ſtill obliged to call all his Guard to their Arms, whenever he ſees him who commands the Watch in chief, let him go as many Rounds as he pleaſeth. Our Rounders propoſe a ſixth queſtion, Whether he who commands a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar<note place="margin" type="runSum">Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                     <hi>Corps de guard,</hi> either in Camp or Garriſon, be he Captain or Lieutenant, be obliged to give the Word to the Grand Round, or if it be enough that the Caporals do it. To which I anſwer, that the Caporals having the Word right is moſt neceſſary, becauſe it is he who receives all the Petty Rounds, and the Word from them: But if the Grand Round demand it from all the Officers, be they what they will, upon all the ſeveral Poſts, they are obliged to give it to him, but this is ſeldome practis'd. When the Caporal hears the<note place="margin">Caporals du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Grand Round.</note> Sentinel, who ſtands at the Court of Guard, bid the Round ſtand, and calls him to come out, he ſhould immediately iſſue with his Sword drawn, and two Musketeers with cock'd Matches attending him: The Caporal is bound to ask, What Round? and if it be anſwer'd, The Great Round, then the Caporal calls out all the Officers and Souldiers to their Arms, and letting the point of his Sword fall, either gives the Great Round the Word, or takes it from him, according to the cuſtome of the place, and after that he waits on him, till he be paſt all the Sentinels on the Walls that belong to that <hi>Corps de guard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Petty or common Rounds, where Guards are ſtrong, are frequently gone,<note place="margin">Common Rounds.</note> by Lieutenants, Enſigns and Sergeants; yea, and by Captains, where all the Watches are commanded by a Colonel, or a Lieutenant Colonel: But for moſt part, Reformadoes, <hi>Appointes,</hi> and Gentlemen of the Company, do that duty, as I ſaid before; nor do they go theſe Petty Rounds when they pleaſe themſelves, but when they are directed to do it by their ſuperiours. At their return, they inform thoſe who ſent them, how vigilant or negligent they found Sentinels and Guards. They are obliged at every <hi>Corps de guard,</hi> to give the Caporal the Word, which if they do not right, he who commands that Guard may diſarm them, and detain them Priſoners, and the two Musketeers (who ordinarily convoy them) till he acquaint the Captain of the Watch with the whole matter. There is a queſtion, when a Round and Counter-round meet<note place="margin">Queſtion concerning them.</note> on the Wall, which of the two ſhall give the Word to the other? Some ſay, that
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:97406:162"/> he who challengeth firſt, ſhould receive it; others aver, that the inferiour ſhould give it to the ſuperiour; ard ſo ſay I, if they know one another, as a Gentleman of a Company to a Sergeant, a Sergeant to an Enſign, and he to a Lieutenant; but they add that equals ſhould paſs by other, without giving it at all, but this may prove dangerous; and truly, I think the beſt way to take away conteſts of that nature, is to ſend no Counter-round at all, but make all the Rounds go one way. Neither do I think the ſending many Rounds the<note place="margin">Too many Rounds uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and hurtful.</note> ſafeſt way to keep good Watch, for Sentinels (as experience daily ſhews) are more careful to take notice of Rounds who are their Friends, than of Enemies, who are without the Walls; eſpecially when they are ſure to be complain'd of and puniſh'd for neglecting to challenge the Rounds, but may eaſily ſhun to be queſtion'd for not challenging an Enemy who ſurprizes them. I have known Watches and Guards kept in better order by a few Rounds, and the Officers who were upon Guard, their frequent viſiting their own Sentinels, than when the Ramparts and Parapets of both Camps and Garriſons, did loudly echo with challenging, Who is there? and anſwering, Round; and then the reply, of either Round go by, or Round ſtand; and for that very ſame reaſon which I gave you but juſt now.</p>
                  <p>There go likewiſe Rounds from the Head Watch through the Streets of Camps and Garriſons, and theſe are called Patrovils; they are ſent to ſee<note place="margin">Patrovils.</note> that no abuſes, thefts, robberies, clamours, ſquabbles or Riots be committed; and if they find any ſuch, they are not to connive at the doers of them, as too many of them do, but are to bring them to the Head Watch till they be examin'd next day; and for this reaſon, I would not have fewer Musketeers Carabiners, or Fire-locks ſent out with a Patrovil than eight or ten, becauſe three or four may be beat back to their Guard by ſome that are very inſolent, with whom no authority will prevail, but that which is armed; and indeed authority is not at all terrible, but when ſhe appears in Arms, for <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>OF all Martial Acts, to fight a Battel well, and gain the Victory, is of the higheſt importance, and makes the Prince or his General moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd: It is this, (and neither Retreats nor taking Towns, though both theſe ſhew the qualifications of an excellent Captain) that crowns them with Laurel: By the winning of Battels, ſometimes one, ſometimes more Kingdoms are gain'd by one party, and loſt by another. Let us then take a view of thoſe things that ſhould be adverted to, before ſo great a hazard be made. Moſt men are of opinion, that he who hath the conduct of an Army ſhould never<note place="margin">Generals ſhould not be forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But when he hath done either of the two, he may be forc'd to fight, for who can ſave his Army without fighting, if his Enemy ſtorms his Retrenchment, or in his Retreat purſues him fiercely and powerfully? To force an Enemy to fight,<note place="margin">To force an Enemy to Battel ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times well.</note> hath a doubtful event, for many times it ſucceeds well, as it did with <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> at <hi>Arbela</hi> againſt <hi>Darius,</hi> with <hi>Scipio</hi> againſt <hi>Hannibal</hi> at <hi>Zama,</hi> with his Brother againſt <hi>Antiochus</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> with <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth againſt the King of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Pavia,</hi> and <hi>Guſtavus</hi> his Army againſt <hi>Wallenſtein</hi> at <hi>Lutſen.</hi> Yet peruſe Hiſtory, you will find that many more have loſt, than ever gain'd by it, take a few inſtances: <hi>Edward,</hi> the Black Prince, was forc'd to fight at <hi>Poi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Sometimes very ill.</note> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to fight at <hi>Bannockburne,</hi> but loſt the honour of the day, and moſt of his numerous Army: <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> made himſelf conſtantly maſter of his own dyet, either by Entrenching or Retiring, ſo that he was never forc'd to fight, but when he pleas'd: But when he forc'd <hi>Pompey,</hi> he try'd both For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. At <hi>Dirrhachium</hi> he was beaten off with loſs, and was glad to retire, which indeed he did with admirable Prudence and Courage: At <hi>Pharſalia</hi> he brav'd the ſame <hi>Pompey</hi> to Battel, which ſo ſoon as he accepted, <hi>Caeſar</hi> got the Victory. Yet it ſeems moſt agreeable to reaſon, that men ſhould fight well, when they are forc'd to fight, Deſpair whetting their Courage; and for this reaſon many Captains take away all means of eſcape from their own Armies, to make them ſenſible their ſafety is in their hands, and not in their feet, and withal, they leave an open way for their Enemy to run away; and hence is the common Maxime in War, That a Bridge of Gold ſhould be made for a Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">A Golden Bridge.</note> Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Before a Battel it is fit to view an Enemies countenance, and try his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, by frequent Skirmiſhes, and theſe very oft (each Army ſending help to their own parties) draw on a Battel inſenſibly. Good Intelligence (if poſſible)<note place="margin">Intelligence.</note> ſhould be had of his numbers of Horſe, Foot, and Artillery, and in which of theſe his greateſt ſtrength lyes; but I will repeat nothing in this place of what I have ſaid in my Diſcourſe of Intelligence. In the next place our General ſhould view (if he have time and opportunity for it) the ſituation of the Field<note place="margin">Situation of the Field.</note> where both his own, and his Enemies Army are to fight, that accordingly he may either lay ambuſhes, or ſhun them: This was one of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces: he ſhould take notice how the Wind blows, that accordingly by the<note place="margin">The Wind.</note>

If his Intelligence be good within his Enemies Army, he ſhould endeavour to ſtir up jealouſies, diviſions, and diſſentions in it, and in the time of theſe, if his<note place="margin">To make an Enemy jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</note> Friends give him the ſign, fall upon him. After his Army is marſhall'd, if he have ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, he ſhould ride along the Front of all his Brigades, and by ſhort Speeches, Couragious looks and geſtures, and with Promiſes of noble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<note place="margin">Harangues.</note> he ſhould enflame the Spirits of his Souldiers with a deſire to fight, and withal, he ſhould aſſure them, that the honour of their Prince, and their own ſafety, depends only on their courage and gallant behaviour, all hopes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat being taken away. But this commendable cuſtome of haranguing Armies by Generals is much worn out in our late Wars; and I ſhrewdly ſuſpect moſt of thoſe Orations we read are the fine fictions of Hiſtorians, who are better at that, than the deſcribing the manner how Generals marſhall'd their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. If a General be ſtrong in Cavalry, he ſhould ſhun fighting in a ſtrait or cloſe Countrey; if his Infantry be numerous, he ſhould ſhun Heaths and Champaigns; yet it is but ſeldome in his power (though ſometimes it be) to chuſe either the one or the other. He ſhould adviſe well with the Maſter of<note place="margin">The planting the Ordnance.</note> the Ordnance, how to plant his Artillery, whether on the Flanks, in the great Intervals, or upon ſome heighth and aſcent, whether that be before or behind the Army, or if his train be great in all theſe places; this ſhould be done before the beginning of the fight, that accordingly Batteries and Beds may be readily made, and the Gunners ready to fire when they are commanded. Our Army being marſhall'd either in one, two, or three Bodies, as our General's own reaſon and experience will direct him, or the ground permit; of which I have ſpoken in the ſeventeenth Chapter. All theſe things being done, the Word and the Sign ſhould be given, and theſe are quickly carried through the Army by the Major Generals and the Adjutants. At ſuce a time the Word<note place="margin">The Word.</note> is ordinarily a Sentence, (for Souldiers are no Grammarians) as, God with us, For God and the King, Our truſt is in God, and <hi>Vivat</hi> ſuch a Prince, and the like. The Sign may be a Handkerchief on the Hat, or a piece of Linnen<note place="margin">The Sign.</note> on the right or left arm, a twig of a Birch, an Elme, an Oak, or a Sycamore, or it may be a Fur, or what elſe the Prince or his General pleaſeth. The Word and Sign are given both to Officers, Common Troopers and Souldiers; and ſometimes they are alter'd in the time of Battel, if there be any ground or<note place="margin">Both many times alter'd.</note> ſuſpicion that the Enemy hath got them, or any of them. I remember, when the <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Being ready to advance to the Charge, the General takes his place, having<note place="margin">The Battel.</note> aſſign'd before, a Station to all his General Officers of the Field. Many have reaſon enough to think that the General himſelf ſhould ſtand in the middle of the Infantry of the Battel, where he uſeth to march, but that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly practis'd, yea, and but ſeldome in our late Wars; for many times he<note place="margin">A Generals ſtation in time of it,</note> who commands in chief takes his ſtation in the right Wing of the Cavalry; ſo did the Great King of <hi>Sweden</hi> at the firſt Battel of <hi>Leipſick,</hi> and ſo he did at <hi>Lutſen</hi> likewiſe: So did Count <hi>Tili</hi> at that ſame Battel at <hi>Leipſick,</hi> and ſo did <hi>Banier</hi> at <hi>Woodſtock.</hi> I told you formerly in my diſcourſe of marſhalling Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, That <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth intending to fight Sultan <hi>Solyman</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> drew up all his Cavalry in the two great Intervals which his three great Batallions of Foot made, fifteen thouſand Horſe were in each of the two Bodies, and in that on the right hand ſtood the Emperour himſelf, and with that on the left, his Brother, King <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> Nor was, nor is, this cuſtome of a Generals ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the right Wing of the Horſe, or between it and the Infantry, a new thing, the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſuls uſing it frequently, when two of them joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Sometimes in our late Wars, when the Army was marſhall'd in Battel<note place="margin">Should be where he pleaſeth.</note> and Reſerve, five General perſons have commanded in five ſeveral places, as thus: In the Right Wing the Commander in chief; in the Body of the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

So the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals order'd their buſineſs at <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> where two of their Armies were joyn'd againſt an <hi>Imperial</hi> and a <hi>Saxiſh</hi> Army. <hi>Banier</hi> the firſt Felt-Marſhal, commanded the Right Wing of the Cavalry; <hi>Leſlie</hi> the ſecond Felt-Marſhal, commanded the Battel of the Avant-guard; Lieutenant General <hi>King</hi> the Left Wing of the Horſe, Lieutenant General <hi>Vitſdrun</hi> the Right hand of the Reſerve, and Major General <hi>Ruthven</hi> the Left. But in ancient times a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of an Army choſe to ſtand where he pleas'd, and where he thought his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence could be moſt ſteadable: ſo <hi>Pompey</hi> made his ſtation in the Right Wing of his Army at <hi>Pharſalia;</hi> which <hi>Caeſar</hi> obſerving, choſe to ſtand on the Left Wing of his, that he might be oppoſite to his Grand Competitor. And I know nothing can tye a General in our times to take a ſtation, or no ſtation to himſelf, but as he pleaſeth. For my own part, I think, he ſhould tye him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to no particular place, but ſhould ride where he ſees or hears the greateſt danger to be. Indeed, he ought to appoint particular ſtations to all his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Field-Officers, from which they ſhould not budge upon any pretence whatſoever, without expreſs command from the Commander in chief, and theſe places ſhould be given them, according to the honour and precedency they enjoy by their ſeveral charges. As let us ſuppoſe he hath under him a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General of the whole Army, a General and Major General of the Horſe, and a General and Major General of the Foot; he may place his Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral<note place="margin">Stations of the general Field-Officers.</note> on the Right Wing of the Avant-guard, the General of the Cavalry on the Left, and the General of the Foot in the Battel, the Major General of the Horſe on the Right Wing of the Reſerve, and the Major General of the Foot on the Left: And keep himſelf free from any one ſtation, to ride with his Adjutants and Guards, where he thinks his preſence is moſt neceſſary, and ſhortly to be an Ubiquitary, that being reſtricted to no place, he may be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">A General an Ubiquitary.</note> where. If he have more General Field Officers than theſe juſt now menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, he may place three more, one on the left hand of the Right Wing, the ſecond on the Left hand of the Left Wing, and the third on the left hand of the Battel.</p>
                  <p>Before the Battel begin, there uſe to be fore-parties of both Horſe and<note place="margin">Forlorn Hopes.</note> Foot ſent out to skirmiſh, theſe are called Forlorn Hopes, and <hi>Enfans Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues:</hi> Thoſe of the Foot ſhould advance one hundred paces before the Body; thoſe of the Horſe further. But I find, at the Battels fought both at <hi>Dreux</hi> and <hi>St. Dennis,</hi> between the Proteſtants and <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks of <hi>France,</hi> none of thoſe Forlorn Hopes were made uſe of at all, and as few were uſed at <hi>Lutſen,</hi> where <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> loſt his life.</p>
                  <p>When an Enemy is marſhalling his Army, your Artillery ſhould inceſſantly<note place="margin">To advance on an Enemy.</note> play upon him, to hinder him all you may to order his affairs; and if your Battel be already marſhall'd, under the ſhelter of your Ordnance, you ſhould advance, and take your advantage of him, before his Batallions or Squadrons be drawn up; but in ſo good order, that the Scene be not changed, that by your precipitation you give not him an opportunity to take advantage of you. Your advance on an Enemy, in what poſture ſoever he be, ſhould be with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, firm, and ſteady pace; the Musketeers (whether they be on the Flanks, or interlin'd with either the Horſe or the Pikes) firing all the while; but when you come within Piſtol-ſhot, you ſhould double your pace, till your Pikes cloſely ſerr'd together, charge theſe, whether Horſe or Foot, whom they find before them. It is true, the buſineſs very oft comes not to puſh of Pike, but it hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and may come oft to it, and then Pike-men are very ſerviceable.</p>
                  <p>If a misfortune fall out, that a Brigade, Regiment, or other part of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my be beat, or begin to run and quit the Field, this ſhould be conceal'd from the reſt of the Army; and the Souldiers told that the Enemy in other places is beaten, and if they fight but a little, the Victory will be inſtantly theirs. I ſhall not ſpeak here of what advantage a large Front is, having done it ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before; but if a General perceive that the buſineſs may be quickly decided,<note place="margin">To marſhal the Foot in three Rank<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:97406:164"/> may fall on his Flank; for at no extraordinary march an Army may be brought to puſh of Pike, before three Ranks of Musketeers have fired ſucceſſively, if they do not begin to fire till they be within diſtance leſs than Musket-ſhot, and after they have given their three Volleys, then they may give the fourth (which will ſignifie as much, if not more, than all the three) by kneeling, ſtooping, and ſtanding; whereof I have ſpoke in the eleventh and twelfth Chapters.</p>
                  <p>When any Regiment or Brigade runs, or offers to quit the Field, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve behind ſhould be order'd immediately to advance, and encounter the Victorious Enemy, who will hardly be able to withſtand that freſh charge, for it may be almoſt received as a Maxime, That a Troop, Regiment or Brigade,<note place="margin">A good Rule, but not Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</note> how ſtrong ſoever it be, which hath fought with and beaten that Body of equal number that ſtood againſt it, may be eaſily routed by a Troop, Regiment, or Brigade that hath not fought, though far inferiour in number.

                  <p>I know not how the propoſition of ſome will reliſh with our great Captains, that ſome luſty ſtrong men ſhould be arm'd with Head-pieces and Corſlet, and long and large Targets, all Musket-proof; and a Rank of theſe ſerr'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, order'd to march before every Batallion of Pikes, and ſo protect them from ſhot, till they be within two Pikes length of the Enemy, that they can make uſe of their own Weapons. But whether this be approv'd or not, I think it would be of no great charge to the Prince or State, who manageth the War, to order every Pike man to have at his girdle a Piſtol, with a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel two foot long, whereof the three firſt Ranks may make uſe before they preſent their Pikes, and the other three fire over the heads of thoſe who are before them, in the time they are charging.</p>
                  <p>Now the Battel is done, and if it fall out, that it hath been ſo well fought,<note place="margin">Things to be done after the Battel.</note> that none of the Armies can boaſt of Victory, but that both have left the place of Combate, as it were by mutual conſent, or that they are parted by night, then either both prepare to fight next day, or the one finding thoſe wants, of which the other hath no knowledge, takes the advantage of darkneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires to ſome place of ſecurity, where he may provide for his hurt men, be furniſh'd with what he wants, recruit his Forces, and ſo give a ſtop to his Enemies further progreſs; and this, no doubt, is a tacite acknowledgement that he yields the honour of the day to him who keeps the Field. But this was never laid in ballance by any prudent Captain with the preſervation of his Army, the loſs whereof may loſe the Prince his Maſter more than ſuch a Punctilio of Honour, which at a more fortunate Rencounter, may quickly be recover'd. But if both reſolve to try their fortunes next day, then both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for it, the wounded are ſent away, Ammunition is given out, and thoſe who are ſound, are refreſh'd and encourag'd. This falls out but ſeldome, though ſometimes it hath happen'd. The Victory is pronounc'd to be his,<note place="margin">Badge of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</note> who remains maſter of the ground where both fought; and in ancient times he acknowledg'd himſelf to be vanquiſh'd, who deſired liberty to bury his dead. <hi>Bernard</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxon Weymar</hi> having beſieged <hi>Reinfeld,</hi> and two Imperial Armies coming to raiſe the Siege, he fought both till night parted the fray, but with this difference, that the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> got between him and the beſieged Town, and ſo ſuccour'd it; upon which the Duke retired, and left his Enemy the badges of Victory; but with a reſolution to return, and throw the Dye of War once more, as he did, as you ſhall hear anon.</p>
                  <p>When an entire Victory is obtain'd, he who hath loſt the day ſhould not loſe<note place="margin">What a Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſhould do.</note> his Courage too, but ought to gather up his Shipwrack, rally his diſpers'd and broken Troops, get new recruits, diſſemble his loſſes, encourage his party,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:97406:165"/> and draw to a head again; theſe are things practis'd by all intelligent Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; withal he ſhould with all convenient diligence ſend a Trumpeter to the Victorious General, to demand a liſt of his Priſoners, which when he hath got, he ſhould make all the haſte he can to get them ranſom'd or exchang'd: and this is a duty he owes to Prudence, Honour and Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, he who hath gain'd the Victory may loſe himſelf if he be<note place="margin">What a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſhould do.</note> ſecure, for a reſolute enemy may ſoon take him napping. As that ſame Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> did the Imperial Army that had beaten him; for having got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the reſt of his Forces that were not with him at his late overthrow, he return'd and gave Battel to the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> who dream'd of no ſuch thing, and obtain'd ſo compleat a Victory over them, that he made all the general per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons his Priſoners, who were led into <hi>Paris</hi> in triumph: <hi>Duc de Savelli,</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> was one of them, who eſcap'd afterward out of Priſon; but the deep contemplation of the ſudden change of fortune in his Military imployments, mov'd him to make an exchange of his Helmet with a Cardinals Cap. It is for that, that he who commands a Victorious Army ſhould not in ſloth paſs away his time, but improve his Victory to the greateſt advantage of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and not be guilty of that whereof one of the greateſt Captains among the Ancients, <hi>Hannibal,</hi> was taxed, that he knew not how to uſe Victory; whereof two others, one before him and another after him, could never be accuſed, and thoſe were the Great <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the Great <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi>

                  <p>TO Retire after a Battel, or a brisk Rencounter, leads me to ſpeak of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats. Next the ſighting well, and winning of a Battel, the three great Maſter-pieces of a Captain are to make a Retreat, to take a fortified place,<note place="margin">Four Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces of a Great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</note> and to defend one: Of the firſt I ſhall ſpeak in this, of the other two, in the two following Chapters. Here I am not to ſpeak of thoſe petty Retreats which parties of Horſe and Foot make purpoſely, diſſembling fear, to make an unwary Enemy follow too eagerly, till he be brought to that Ambuſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to intrap him, as is frequently practis'd in skirmiſh, when two Armies face each other, or in Battel when they fight, or when either an Army or a ſtrong party faceth a Town, whether it be block'd up or not. But this diſcourſe is of the Retreat of an Army, from the Poſt it once undertook to maintain from the Countrey, through which it once intended to march, or from the Town, Caſtle or Fort, which it once intended to beſiege, or block up.</p>
                  <p>The occaſions of Retreats may be theſe, Peſtilence, Flux, or other contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<note place="margin">Occaſions and Reaſons of Retreats.</note> Diſeaſes in the Army, want of Proviſions and Munitions, the approach of an unexpected or a ſtrong Enemy, ſome Diſorders, Diſcontents or Mutinies, or juſt apprehenſions of them; the couragious, or ſometimes obſtinate holding out of a fortified place, contrary to expectation; the ſudden diminution of the Army by ſome accident of War not foreſeen, or to joyn with thoſe Forces who are coming to ſtrengthen the Army, which conjunction, without ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, might be hinder'd by an active Enemy. Or though none of thoſe be, yet he who commands an Army often retires, for reaſons known only to himſelf, or when he thinks it not conducible for his Maſters ſervice to hazard Battel with an Enemy, though no ſtronger, perhaps not ſo ſtrong as himſelf.</p>
                  <p>To make a Retreat from an advancing Enemy, or from Armies whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction cannot be hinder'd, is not at all difficult, if he who is to make it,<note place="margin">Retreats ſhould be made in time.</note> have ſo good Intelligence as he may begin it in time; but if it be bad or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, or that his Scouts and Parties diſappoint him, nothing is more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult;
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:97406:165"/> and in this place I refer you to my Diſcourſe of Intelligence; when an Enemy is near, orders are given and obeyed with ſo great haſte and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the March looks rather like a flight than a retreat: and this hath ruined many Armies, and loaded their Generals with diſhonour and diſgrace.</p>
                  <p>If for want of good intelligence, an enemy comes unlooked for, or that a General have fought with loſs; in both theſe caſes, the retreat ſhould begin in the night. It is true, all Retreats infuſe fear in an Army, which is aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the darkneſs and horror of the night, and therefore the common Souldiers ſhould be encouraged, and told by their ſeveral Officers, that the Retreat will be but of a ſhort continuance, and that if an Enemy follow, they will face about and fight him; but withal very ſtrict and ſevere Diſcipline ſhould be kept that none ſtraggle, for in ſuch occaſions, they are very apt to run away, and indeed at ſome times, and in ſome places, it is better to haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard a Battle than to offer to retire; for if an Army muſt be loſt, it is done<note place="margin">To begin a Retreat in the Night.</note> with more honour by the firſt than by the laſt. But if an Enemy be near and a Retreat is reſolved on, it ſhould I ſay begin in the night, becauſe in the day time it will be ſeen, and then it is not to be ſuppoſed, that an Enemy will be ſo ſupinely negligent, as not to follow the Rear immediately; but though one Enemy know of anothers diſlodging, yet he will be very cautious to purſue him in the night time, having juſt reaſons to fear Ambuſhes and other ſtratagems; and if a retiring Army get the advantage of one nights march, he who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it may next day poſſeſs himſelf of ſome fortified place or Paſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be able to force him who follows to ſtand, and then he may adviſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">In ſome caſes better Fight than Retire.</note> it will be more convenient for his affairs, to continue his retreat or to fight, and many times this laſt ſucceeds well, but ſometimes it ſucceeds ill; but I ſay ſtill, better fight than ſtill retire, when the retreat cannot probably be made without the loſs of all or moſt of the Army. A Champaine or a long Heath, a numerous Cavalry of a purſuing Enemy, the wearineſs of both Men and Horſes of the retiring Army, hunger and want of ſleep very often render the fighting a Battle more feaſible than a Retreat. <hi>Cornelius Arvina</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Dictator, perceiving the <hi>Sabines</hi> would ſtorm his Camp, not yet well fortified, left his fires all burning, and retired in the dead time of the night,<note place="margin">Inſtances.</note> with all imaginable ſilence and diligence; but being overtaken next morning, and ſeeing he could not make his Retreat good without a viſible loſs, faced about and fought with ſucceſs. <hi>Cneius Scipio</hi> ſped not ſo well, becauſe he fought not in time. This Conſul perceiving three Armies againſt him in <hi>Spain,</hi> retired in the night time; next day the Enemies Cavalry was in his Rear, with whom he only skirmiſhed, but that retarded his March ſo much, that the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But many who have preferred a vain punctilio of honour to the ſafety of their Armies, have loſt both their Armies and their honours. Whereof take only two inſtances.

                  <p>The ſecond inſtance is of <hi>Piter Strozzi,</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> who commanded in chief over an Army of <hi>French</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, near to <hi>Sienna,</hi> within which Marſhal <hi>Monluc</hi> was Governour; An Army of <hi>Spaniards</hi> under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Medici,</hi> ſtronger by far than <hi>Strozzi,</hi> lay cloſe by him. <hi>Strozzi</hi> reſolves to retire to <hi>Luſignan,</hi> but would needs do it in the day time, and conſulted the matter by Letters with <hi>Monluc,</hi> who diſſwaded him from it, with many reaſons, and particularly by the freſh example of the late King of <hi>France</hi> his retreat in the night-time from <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and ſo prevailed with him to retire in the Night-time. And ſo ſoon as day was ſpent, he ſent away two Pieces of Ordnance to <hi>Luſignan,</hi> intending to follow with the Army. But the haughty <hi>Florentine</hi> looking upon it as a diſhonourable thing for him to ſhow his<note place="margin">Error in <hi>Stroz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi</hi> his retreat from <hi>Sienna.</hi>
                     </note> back in the night-time to <hi>Medici,</hi> to whoſe Family he carried an inveterate hatred, would needs make his Retreat in ſpight of him in the day time; and the iſſue was, his Army was routed, and himſelf hardly eſcaped. But that which <hi>Monluc</hi> writes of this, is very obſervable, That he no ſooner under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that <hi>Strozzi</hi> had reſolved to retire in the day-time, but foreſeeing the event of ſo frantick a reſolution, he inſtantly conveened the Podeſta, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and principal Citizens of <hi>Sienna,</hi> and aſſured them the Army in which they truſted, at that very time and hour in which he was ſpeaking to them, was defeated, and therefore adviſed them without delay to prepare for a Siege; and the event ſhewed he ſpoke truly, if not Prophetically, for that day was the <hi>French</hi> Army beaten, and next day the City was inveſted by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Army.</p>
                  <p>It is true, two of King <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Generals, <hi>Cazzianer</hi> and <hi>Rocandolf,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Retreats ſhould be made in time.</note> (each whereof loſt an Army to their Maſter of 24000, or 30000. brave <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>) retired, the firſt from <hi>Eſecchio,</hi> the laſt from <hi>Buda,</hi> both in the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, but they did it not ſoon enough, and loſt their Armies deſervedly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they obſtinately continued at theſe places againſt all reaſon, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their principal Officers, when they had certain intelligence of the daily march and approach of the Turks. I never ſaid, nor thought that a Retreat in the Night would infallibly ſave an Army; I have been an eye-witneſs of the contrary, but I ever ſaid, and ſtill think, that when an Enemy is near, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat is much more proper to be begun in the Night than in the day. The timely and orderly breaking up and retiring of Armies from the Sieges of Towns, hath ſaved many of them, whereof it will be more proper to ſpeak in the next Chapter, when I diſcourſe of the Sieges of Towns and Fortified places.</p>
                  <p>The manner of Retreats, whether they be made by day or by night, uſeth<note place="margin">The manner of a Retreat.</note> to be this. 1. The whole Train of Artillery (except ſome Field-pieces, which ſhould ſtay in the Rear) with the Generals Coaches, Chancery, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Secretary, are ſent away with a ſtrong Convoy of Foot and ſome Horſe, then all the ſick and wounded men, next to them the Baggage of the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, next to it a party of Horſe, behind whom comes the whole Brigades of Foot, and after them the Cavalry, and in the Rear of it all the Dragoons, with as many commanded Musketeers out of the ſeveral Foot-Regiments as the Commander in chief thinks fitting, and as many of them mounted on Horſes as can be, and behind them a ſelect party of Horſe and Foot for preſent ſervice, which are to be relieved by turns, by thoſe who are before them, one Party ſtill facing the Enemy till the Party that was behind them be paſt. This is to be obſerved if the whole Army march one way; but if it can divide and go ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wayes, the expedition will be the greater, the time and place being named (the laſt whereof ſhould be a Paſs or fortified place) by the General where all ſhall meet, ſo that he who is firſt ſhall ſtay for the reſt, unleſs ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand be given afterward to the contrary. The ſame order in retiring is to be kept by ſeveral grand Diviſions or Wings of the Army, as if it marched in one Body.</p>
                  <p>But the truth is, the Baggage of an Army makes ſo long a train, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards<note place="margin">Waggons and Carts rather to be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in the highways than to be burnt in a cloſe Countrey.</note> the Retreat exceedingly, eſpecially where there are encloſures and hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and thefore I wonder that in all Retreats, order is not given to leave all Waggons and Carts behind, (for in a cloſe Country that will be a great deal more advantagious than to burn them) and every man ſhould take his beſt
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:97406:167"/> and moſt precious things out of them, leaving all traſh and luggage of ſmall value in them (which will likewiſe retard the purſuing Enemy) and theſe goods the officers ſhould caſt upon one Horſe, or two at the moſt, and upon the reſt of the Baggage-Horſes either ſick men ſhould be mounted, or Musketeers for ſervice, and this ſhould be ſeen done by the Colonels themſelves under pain of I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In all Retreats great care ſhould be taken that none get leave to fall behind, to prevent which not only all the Superiour and Inferiour Officers of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould do their duties, but the General Marſhals ſhould ſeverely execute their power againſt Delinquents; and here, if at any time, it is lawful to ſhoot thoſe who will not keep Rank and File. I told you that ſome light Field-pieces ſhould be left in the Rear, for there they may be ſerviceable; and the loſs is not great; if they be taken, for if he who commands the Army ſee he cannot with any probability <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I have heard that the ſtaying two or three hours for a Mortar which was a great one, and bemired in deep and dirty way, occaſion'd the loſs of Prince Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and Lieutenant General <hi>King</hi>'s little Armies in their Retreat from <hi>Lemgaw</hi> to <hi>Vlotho.</hi> When a party of either Horſe or Foot, or of both, perceives they are neither able to fight, nor retire in a Body, it hath been, and may be practis'd to disband the party; he who leads it, bidding every man that belongs to it to go what way he pleaſeth, or ſhall find moſt ſafe or convenient for him, and to meet at ſuch a place as he then names, ſo ſoon as poſſibly they can.</p>

                  <p>THE Art to take fortified Towns and Caſtles, hath been always, and ſtill is accounted one of the neceſſary endowments of a Great Captain. The manner uſed by the Ancients, and thoſe of later times is ſtill the ſame; for Breaches made by the Ram, and by the Cannon are ſtill Breaches; and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches made by the help of the Vines, Tortoiſes and Muſcles, and without<note place="margin">Three ways to take fortified places.</note> them, are ſtill Approaches. Fortified places may be taken three ſeveral ways, by Intelligence, by Surprizal, and by Siege. Of theſe three, that which lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth leaſt time, and coſts leaſt Blood, is to be choſen; and therefore that of Intelligence with a party within the Fort is the eaſieſt and the ſafeſt, and this, without doing it wrong, you may in plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> call Treachery: It proceeds<note place="margin">By Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> principally from the villany of ſome within; and though this be one of the moſt hateful vices that corrupt our depraved nature, yet Princes and their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals look upon themſelves to be obliged not only to cheriſh it in an Enemy, but to hire men to commit it at exceſſive rates: For the price a Traytor will ſeek for the delivery of a Town, Cittadel or Caſtle, will ſeldome exceed that which the maintenance of an Army will amount to in two or three days: This is <hi>Amo proditionem.</hi> Whether it be lawful for men to ſolicite, encourage, yea, to hire men to ſin, I leave to the Divines; but I can aſſure them, Military men think it very convenient to practiſe it. This way of taking Towns, <hi>Philip,</hi> Father of <hi>Alexander</hi> called his Golden Key. This treachery is committed either by the Governour, and then the whole Town or Fort is betrayed, and the hazzard which he without runs is little or none at all; or it is committed by one man, or one party within the Town, by betraying a Port, or Poſt, or part of the Wall, whereby he who commands without, may quickly make himſelf maſter of the whole Fort; but here he runs the hazzard of oppoſition from thoſe who are not in the Conſpiracy: But he to whom the place ſhould<note place="margin">A tickliſh piece.</note> be betray'd, ought to take good heed that he be not cheated, for it is a tickliſh piece. All Intelligences ſhould not, nay, few Intelligences are to be truſted. I have told you in my diſcourſe of Intelligence, how wary a General ſhould be to truſt thoſe who offer to betray Forts, and gave you ſome Inſtances of thoſe who have been abuſed by it; let me add one more out of the Duke of <hi>Roan</hi>'s Memoires: A <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Gentleman, one <hi>Meſlay,</hi> who had married a Proteſtant Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e,<note place="margin">A Traytor not to be truſted.</note> pretended ſome diſcontent with his own party, and having a Foot Company within <hi>Montpellier,</hi> watched every<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fourth night in the Cittadel; this, upon a ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation of very advantageous conditions, he offers to deliver to a Couſin of his own, one <hi>Bretigni,</hi> a Proteſtant Gentleman, who ſerv'd in the Duke of <hi>Roan</hi>'s Army: After ſome demurr, the Duke approv'd of the matter, and march'd with ſix thouſand men very near <hi>Montpellier,</hi> ſent fifteen hundred men with <hi>Bretigni</hi> the Architect of the deſign, but advis'd him not to hazzard with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Cittadel, till <hi>Meſlay</hi> came out and put himſelf in his hands; but credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Bretigni</hi> neglected this ſo important a part of the buſineſs, and enter'd with thirty ſeven well arm'd men; the Traytor not daring to let more come in: <hi>Bretigni</hi> and his Brother and ſixteen more were kill'd, and nineteen taken Priſoners. <hi>Roan</hi> who was not far off with the groſs of his Army, retir'd in good order, more ſorry for the loſs of two brave Gentlemen, than the miſſing the Cittadel, as having miſtruſted the deſign all along.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond way of taking fortified places is Surprizal, whereof there<note place="margin">By ſurprizal.</note> are ſo many kinds that they cannot all be reckon'd: Sometimes Forts are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:97406:168"/> by Souldiers diſguiſed like Countrey people, both as men and Women with ſhort Carabines, Piſtols, or Daggers under their Cloths, wherewith they diſpatch a Guard, and ſo are maſters of a Port, and immediately give the ſign to them to advance, who are ordained to ſecond them. Sometimes it is done by Armed men hidden in Waggons and Carts under a little Hay, or Straw, whereof the firſt ſtops on the draw-Bridg to hinder the drawing it up, then all leap out of their Waggons, and whilſt ſome are killing the Watch, others are underproping the Portcullies with Forks, made purpoſely for hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it to fall; in the meantime they give the ſign to their Friends, who are not far off. Sometimes a Town is ſurprized by an Enemies entring man by man at a Poſtern or hole made for evacuation, or at ſome ruinous place of the Wall; ſometimes by a ſudden and unforeſeen ſcalado; ſometimes by petard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ports or Draw-bridges. If any of theſe wayes of ſurprizal ſucced, it is the next eaſy way to intelligence. In the next Chapter you may read how Forts are defended againſt all theſe wayes of ſurpriſal.</p>
                  <p>The third way to take Fortified places, is by Siege, and it is twofold,<note place="margin">By a Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade.</note> either by not making approaches, which is called a Blockade, or by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, and this is more properly called a Siege. A Blockade is made by a General when he hath hopes to ſtarve a Garriſon, as knowing that they within have either conſumed their Victuals themſelves, or lent them to their Friends; and this was <hi>Briſac</hi>'s condition when the Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> blocked it up. The way to block a place, is, to lay Regiments and Companies of Foot and Horſe at all Paſſes, Advenues, or other convenient places, to hinder all perſons, all Proviſions, and all things to enter the Blockaded Fort. This way to take Forts ſaves blood, and is of leaſt danger, provided he who blocks up the Fort be abſolute Maſter of the Field during the whole time of the Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade, but it ordinarily loſeth very much time to the Beſieger, for I have known a Town blocked a whole year, and not taken then without a petty Battle.</p>
                  <p>A Siege properly ſo called, is, when an Army inveſts the place, entrencheth<note place="margin">By a Siege.</note> it ſelf, makes Approaches, Redoubts, Batteries, Zaps, Galleries and Mines, and after all that, either leaves it or takes it by ſurrender or aſſault. The forming and carrying on a Siege is no ſmall Maſter-piece of a General, to whoſe own ſpirit, conduct and prudence, many circumſtances muſt be left; as to the conſideration of the nature, ſtrength or weakneſs of the place he is to beſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> or weak reſiſtance he may expect from the Garriſon within; of which and of the abilities of the Governour he ſhould have good Intelligence: He ſhould alſo have a ſerious conſideration of his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,<note place="margin">Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before a Siege be formed.</note> Money, Meat and Munitions; and many more particulars, of which, and concerning which, no definite or certain rules can be given. And before he form or lay down his Siege, he ought to weigh and conſider well all the advantages and diſadvantages that may accrue to him: As whether the gaining the Town or Caſtle he Beſiegeth will counterpoize the loſs of men, and that vaſt expence of money, meat and munitions, that muſt be hazzarded and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed in reducing it; how long time his own Proviſions will be able to hold out, whether he be able with probability of ſucceſs, to withſtand or fight any Enemy that dare adventure the relief of the Beſieged place. And that which concerns moſt both his Maſters ſervice and his own honour, is to caſt up his account ſo well, that if any unexpected accident or adventure fall out, ſuch as are the change of Weather, inundations of Waters, a mighty and unlooked for Succourſe, a Peſtilence or other heavy diſeaſe in his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Army, he may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe, and in ſpight of an Enemy, raiſe his Siege, and march away to places of ſafety, and conſequently make an honourable Retreat with little or no loſs of Men; for it is not to be thought that an Army marcheth away from a Beſieged place with diſhonour, becauſe <hi>ratio B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:97406:168"/> is taken to Beſiege a place, diligence and expedition ſhould be uſed, that all Paſſes, High-wayes and Avenues be poſſeſt by the Cavalry, that no entrance to the Fort be permitted; and that all Citizens or Souldiers belonging to it, be ſeized on and made Priſoners, that intelligence may be got of all affairs within. Many Generals at Sieges entrench their Armies, and many do not. Thoſe<note place="margin">At ſome Sieges Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are not entrench'd.</note> who do not, have no apprehenſion of an Enemy, and therefore upon intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the approach of one, they muſt be ready to march, either to meet and fight that Enemy, or leave both him and the Beſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eged place for good and all; both which I have known practiſed. Thoſe who Entrench their Armies,<note place="margin">Armies En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched at Sieges.</note> take the far ſurer way; though the doing it coſts a great deal of time and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The Entrenchment muſt be made both againſt thoſe within the Town, and againſt any without, who will hazzard to relieve it. The Fortifications of the Camp are properly called the <hi>Trenches,</hi> (though the word be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken for approaches) and in that word are comprehended the lines of Communication, which Lines are divided into ſeveral parts, Field-ſconces, whole and half Bulwarks, Star-works and Redouts. None of theſe ſhould have a Curtain between them above ſix or ſeven hundred foot long, for the diſtance of them one from another ſhould be leſs than a Musket ſhot. They ſhould be built of black Earth, if it can be had; but if the ground be ſandy, it muſt be knit together with Withs, faſcines, Straw, or growing Corn, and without with a Ditch and Palliſado. Of the ſame matter ſhould the Redouts and Batteries in the approaches be built. The Star-ſconces having their ſides 40 or 50 foot long, and their points far diſtant, are ordinarily made in haſt, when time will not permit better to be made.</p>
                  <p>If an Army be numerous enough, or that there be ſtore of Pioneers with it, a General may fortify his Camp, and begin his approaches both together, and this will ſave him much time, which in ſuch occaſions is very precious. But if he cannot do both at once, he ſhould Entrench himſelf, and then begin thoſe works, which are called Approaches, running Trenches, and by the <hi>Dutch La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Foot broad, and thereafter 10, or 12. broad; ſometimes more,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:97406:169"/> if it be neceſſary to make uſe of Waggons in the approaches, which falls out ſometimes. At the end of this firſt Line a Redout is to be made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this is a<note place="margin">A Redout E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilateral.</note> work of four ſides and four Angles, for moſt part equilateral, each ſide 40, 50, or 60. foot long: And ſometimes, but very ſeldome, Redouts are built of an oblong figure, and then the longeſt ſide may be of 120, 100. and the ſhorteſt<note place="margin">An oblong one.</note> 40, 50, or 60. foot. From that Redout another approach runs 5, 6, or 700. foot long to the other hand in the ſame manner, and at the end thereof another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dout or Battery ſhould be made, from whence begins the third running Line to that hand, that the firſt Trench did run, and ſo alternately till Batteries be made, and the Zap begin. Obſerve, that the ground without, on which the approaches are to be made, is divided by the Generals appointment into ſeveral Poſts. The approaches whereof to the Beſieged Fort, go equally on; and therefore all the Redouts and Batteries of them ſhould defend, flank, and ſecure one another againſt the outfalls and Sallies of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged.</p>
                  <p>The nearer the approach come to the Ditch of the Fort, the deeper and broader it ſhould be, the better to defend the Souldiers; and the deeper any work be, that requires a Breaſt-work, the higher will the top of that Breaſt-work<note place="margin">Breaſt-works, and Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks.</note> be: for that reaſon, many times three ſteps of a foot bank will be neceſſary for Souldiers to aſcend to the defence of their Breaſt-works, either in caſe of Sallies, or yet to give fire upon the Parapets of the Towns For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch convenient places of theſe approaches, as either the General of the Artillery or Quartermaſter General (for to their charges and inſpection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Approaches) ſhall think fit, ſome of theſe Sconces ſhould be made, which commonly are called Batteries; for properly a Battery is nothing elſe but<note place="margin">A Battery.</note> the Platform on which the Ordnance ſtand, which is alſo called the Bed of the Cannon; and on theſe Batteries ſuch Pieces are planted as are thought neceſſary, ordinarily whole and Demi-Cannon, and whole and Demi-Culverine. In making theſe Redouts &amp; Trenches, conſideration ſhould be had of the nature of the Earth that is digged; if it be good black Earth, it will ſerve without help for Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works; but if not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then muſt Baskets be made, and filled with Earth or Sand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactly. But whether the Breaſt-work be of Earth, or made of Gabions, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary it be ten or twelve foot thick. If the ground be mariſh, no doubt, it will<note place="margin">Gabions and Baskets.</note> exceedingly retard the Approaches; for Wooden palls muſt be ſtruck in the Earth, and Withs, Straw and Rubbiſh laid upon them for a foundation to a Battery; and upon the Battery, Gabions and Baskets filled with Earth, as was done by Prince <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> at the Siege of the <hi>Buſch,</hi> and there he was well helped in that mariſh Ground by a dry Summer. Where a running<note place="margin">Some running Trenches direct, ſome oblique, ſome Serpentine.</note> Trench is made, if the ground be tollerably good, and yet mariſh on both ſides, it muſt be made in a ſtreight and direct Line, and not an oblique one, as the other whereof I ſpoke: and for the defence of the Souldiers, there muſt be blinds, and the Trench it ſelf ſhould be two foot deeper than an approach which is either crooked or ſerpentine.</p>
                  <p>When the Approaches are brought near the Ditch of the Beſieged place, the Counter-ſcarp (which is the ſhield of the Fortreſs) is in danger, and then the Zappe begins. This Sappe or Zappe is nothing elſe but a digging, as all<note place="margin">Zappe why ſo called.</note> the reſt of the Approaches are; but men have appropriated it to that digging which is near to, or in the Counter-ſcarp. We have borrowed it from the <hi>Italian,</hi> in which Language <hi>Zappa</hi> ſignifies a Mattock, <hi>Zapare</hi> to dig or delve, and <hi>Zappamento</hi> a digging or delving. The Sappe then begins at both ſides or faces of the Bulwark, towards which the approaches have been made, ſometimes but on one ſide the Souldiers Zappe under favour of the Canon, which ſhould play luſtily from the ſeveral Batteries, and of the Musketeers, who ſhould inceſſantly fire upon the Flanks and Parapets of the Baſtion, from both Batteries and Redouts; the manner of Sapping is this: Againſt that part<note place="margin">The manner of a Zappe.</note> of the Bulwark which the Beſiegers intend to undermine, (which ordinarily is the capital point, or that angle that coupleth the two faces of the Baſtion) one man kneeling or bowing, digs three foot deep and three foot broad, throwing the Earth both before and on both ſides of him, and ſtill advanceth; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther follows him cloſe, and makes it three foot broader and deeper, if the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:97406:169"/> Ground permit it; to him ſucceeds the third, who adds three foot more to the depth and breadth, ſo that a man may walk covered. In this manner (the Zappers being often reliev'd by turns) the Zap is continued, till they have digg'd through the Counterſcarp, which muſt be done, though it be lin'd with Stone and Mortar, otherwiſe all their labour is loſt. When this is finiſh'd, the Beſiegers are to fight with the two mercileſs Enemies and Elements of Fire and Water, the firſt from the Walls of the Fort, the ſecond from the Ditch, over which they muſt be, before they come to the Wall, for doing whereof all the Earth and rubbiſh that hath been caſt out in Zapping, muſt be caſt in<note place="margin">How to fill the Moat.</note> the Foſs; and with it, a world of Faſcines, which are bundles or knitchels of the twigs and ſmaller branches of Trees, in every one whereof ſhould be S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There muſt likewiſe uſe be made of great logs of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, great Stones, and ſacks full of Sand, or any thing elſe that may be thought fitting to fill the Ditch; and this is continued without intermiſſion (your Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Musket firing inceſſantly on the Flanks and Parapets of the beſieged) till a damm be made to the place you would be at, ſuppoſe it be that angle of a Bulwark I juſt now ſpoke of, becauſe it hath no other defence but from that part of the Curtain which is called the ſecond Flank, which, for that reaſon, the Beſiegers ſhould make as uſeleſs as may be with Cannon and Culverine.

If a breach or <hi>Briche</hi> be reſolv'd on, it is the moſt expenſive way; for, as I told you in my Diſcourſe of Artillery, ſome require to make a <hi>breche,</hi> eighteen pieces of Ordnance, eight whole Cannons, ſix Culverines, and four Demi-Culverines; and for theſe ſome Gunners require three Batteries, one for the Cannon to ſhoot in a direct line, and two for the Culverines to ſhoot croſswiſe or obliquely, to cut away thoſe parts of the Wall which the Cannon hath ſhaken. I ſhall not trouble you with a diſcourſe of Batteries, which are thoſe platforms of Boards on which the Pieces ſtand, how even and plain they ſhould be made, that they ſhould be higher behind than before, according to the greatneſs of the Piece is to be planted on them, both to hinder her to recoil too far, and bring her the more eaſily forward to her Loop hole; nor of the length of a platform to fit a piece for her carriage and recoil; nor of the ſeveral ſorts of Batteries, as thoſe of Earth, of Timber, and of Woollen Sacks; nor of ſunk Batteries, nor of the <hi>Appareill,</hi> which is nothing but the aſcent to the Battery, for the more eaſie bringing up the Cannon to it: All theſe things, and many more concerning Batteries, belonging properly to the Gunners Art, and but accidentally to this Diſcourſe. I ſhall only tell you, that when a <hi>Breche</hi> is to be made, Gunners differ about the diſtance that ſhould be between<note place="margin">Diſtance of Batteries from the place to be battered.</note> the Battery, and the Wall to be batter'd. Some are of opinion that one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty paces are far enough, and that no Battery ſhould be made fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the mark; and thoſe ſay likewiſe that the neareſt Battery ſhould be four hundred foot from the mark: Others ſay two hundred foot makes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient diſtance, and a third ſort (it may be with greateſt reaſon) aver, that a Battery at the Counterſcarp, where only the breadth of the Moat is between the Battery and the Wall hath the greateſt force, and the Ordnance prove moſt
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:97406:170"/> efficacious. But the nearer the Battery be, the greater care ſhould be taken that their Parapets be ſo ſtrongly and well contriv'd, that neither the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance may be in danger of diſmounting, nor the Gunners and Matroſſes in haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their lives, but neither theſe, nor many things elſe can be ſecur'd by the wit of man. Theſe old Stone Towers that ſtand on Walls, fortified <hi>a l'antique,</hi> ought to be batter'd down, at leaſt their Parapets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I have ſeen more hurt done from thoſe to Approaches, than from either Curtain or Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of any Modern Fortification.</p>
                  <p>I have ſaid, that to make a breach ſome require three Batteries, one for the<note place="margin">Three ſeveral Batteries to make a breach.</note> 8 Cannon, the ſecond for the 6 Culverines, and the third for the 4 Demi-Culve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines. The firſt to play on direct angles, which terribly ſhakes the Wall; the ſecond to play traverſly and croſs, to cut out what the Cannon hath ſhaken, and the third to beat down the Parapets, or render them uſeleſs. By this means it is conceived, that in leſs than twelve hours time a ſufficient breach may be made, which the Defendants muſt not be permitted to repair, for an Aſſault ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follow. Nor will I in this place trouble my Reader with the different opinions of Gunners, yea of Captains, whether it be more conducible for gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fort, to make a breach in a Bulwark or a Curtain. Some ſay, as I<note place="margin">Whether to batter a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark.</note> told you formerly, the faces of a Bulwark near the Capital having leaſt defence, are with leaſt danger attack'd and aſſaulted, and therefore ſhould be firſt bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd; others think, that Baſtions having moſt <hi>terreplein</hi> (for we muſt ſuppoſe them full of Earth) render Breaches for a long time ineffectual, becauſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo much Earth ſo near at hand, they may quickly be repaired, and other Retrenchments may be made ſucceſſively behind one, two, or more breaches; whereas there is a far greater difficulty to do ſo in a Curtain, where there is no more earth or <hi>terreplein</hi> than the thickneſs of the Rampart; and to that, that the danger of aſſaulting a Curtain comes from two Flanks of the two neareſt Baſtions, they ſay, they may be made uſeleſs before the Aſſault both by the direct and traverſe Cannon, adding of Demi-Culverines, Quarter Cannons, and Field-pieces.</p>
                  <p>But having overcome the difficulties of the Moat, it is many times thought fit to lodge at the foot of either Bulwark or Curtain, and there to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine. What uſe the Ancients made of Mines, I have ſhewn you in its<note place="margin">Mines.</note> proper place; nor are Mines other things now than they were in the days of yore, except that they differ in their contrivances; for of old, the principal end of Mining was to underdrop the Wall with Timber, till the underminer was order'd to fire that Timber, and therefore the Mine might be greater and wider than now, when Gun-powder is to be put into it. <hi>Norton</hi> in his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Artillery ſays, that <hi>Pietro di Navarra</hi> was the firſt who made uſe of<note place="margin">Pietro di Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varra.</note> Gun-powder in Mines, and made Furns or Ovens, or as we call them, Powder Chambers. If this be true, (as I know nothing to the contrary) it ſeems ſtrange to me, that the compoſition of Powder being found out by the <hi>German</hi> Monk about the year of our Lord 1301. it ſhould not have been uſed in Mines two hundred and thirty years after its invention, for it is not yet one hundred and thirty years ſince <hi>Pietro di Navarra</hi> dyed. He was a very ingenious man, and a ſubtile and vigilant Captain, for his great and good ſervices <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth gave him great rewards, and made him an Earl: But <hi>Pietro</hi> having deſerted him twice, and gone over to the <hi>French</hi> King, he was taken at the Siege of <hi>Naples,</hi> and kept Priſoner in the <hi>Caſtel del Ovo</hi> (which by his dexterity himſelf had formerly taken from the <hi>French</hi> for that ſame <hi>Charles</hi>) and old, crazy, and ſickly as he was, his Head, by order from the Emperour, was appointed to be taken off; but the morning before his execution, it was prevented either by himſelf, or his favourable Guardian <hi>Hickard,</hi> and he was found dead in his Bed, as <hi>Giovio</hi> relates the ſtory.</p>
                  <p>To demoliſh a Wall by a Mine is to be preferr'd to a Battery, for two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; firſt, it is of far leſs expence; ſecondly, Batteries being ſoon perceiv'd, may be made uſeleſs, by Countermures and Retrenchments; but Mines are more imperceptible, yet they are dangerous works for them that are in them, becauſe of Countermines, which when the Mine-maſter finds, he is to divert his courſe<note place="margin">Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines.</note> to the Right or Left hand, or ſink his Mine deeper; and if the Counterminers be under him, he had need make haſte and take his advantage, by piercing
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:97406:170"/> holes, and chacing them away with ſcalding Water. But take a few general Rules for Mines. The entrance ſhould be ſeven foot high and five foot broad, ſay ſome; four foot and a half high and four broad, ſay others: This laſt, and indeed perhaps no Mine is for a fat corpulent man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Mine all along<note place="margin">General Rules for Mining.</note> muſt be lin'd on both ſides, and cover'd above with boards, and underpropt for keeping up the Earth. The mouth of the Mine ſhould be carefully conceal'd from the beſieged. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who was afterwards beaten by the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul <hi>Flaminius,</hi> did not ill to cauſe a great heap of Earth to be laid on the other ſide of a beſieged Town, there where his real Mines were, and ſo deluded the beſieged. The heighth and breadth of the Mine ſhould decreaſe, and grow leſs by little and little, from the entry till it arrive at the place which ſhould be undermined, ſo that the mouth of the Furn ſhould be no wider than to receive the Veſſels wherein the Powder is, whether theſe be Barrels or Troughs. Some will have this Powder Chamber to be ſix or ſeven foot high, four or five broad, and five or ſix long; others ſay, only four foot and a half high, the breadth four, or three foot and a half: But I think aſſuredly it ſhould be proportion'd to the quantity of the Powder, and the number of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that are ordain'd to be put into it. Theſe Furns ſhould be cloſely and ſtrongly ſtopp'd, that the Powder get no vent, but that which naturally it ſeeks, upwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The train whereby the Powder in the Furn is to be fired,<note place="margin">The Train<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> ſhould be ſo well order'd that it be not too long a firing, for that diſappoints them who are to ſtorm, making them apprehenſive of danger of they know not what: And this occaſion'd the death of two <hi>French</hi> Marſhals within theſe forty years, who admiring why the Mine did not ſpring, after they had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the train to be fired, went into the Mine to know the cauſe, where they both dyed; the Mine at their being there, working its effect: Nor muſt it fire too ſoon, leſt he who fires the train, be buried in the ruins of the Mine. Beſides Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining,<note place="margin">What hinders Mines to ſpring.</note> ſeveral things hinder the effectual operation of a Mine; ſuch are, the ill ſtopping the Powder-Chamber, the weakneſs of the ſides, occaſion'd by Countermines, Caves, Caverns, and hollow grounds, as alſo the failing of the train in its duty, by reaſon of its wetneſs, moiſture, or ſome bad contrivance, and the placing the Powder too low in the Furn. When a Mine hath ſprung<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it caſt the Wall outwards towards the Beſiegers it makes the entrance very difficult for the aſſailants, if the Defendants act their part with Courage; and it is juſt ſo with a breach after a Battery, which <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and his General the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> experimented at the memorable Siege of <hi>Metz.</hi>

                  <p>When large Breaches are made by furious Batteries, and that Mines have<note place="margin">Aſſaults.</note> operated happily, then an univerſal Aſſault ſhould be given by the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged Army, each part of it being to ſtorm at its aſſigned Poſt. Theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults being given reſolutely, and continued obſtinately, though the firſt or ſecond may perhaps be beat off, will probably reduce the place: And then it will be a noble part of the Victorious General to order fair<note place="margin">Fair quarter to be give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The like hath been often practis'd in the Modern Wars, but the cuſtome is almoſt worn out, the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der belonging to thoſe who can take it, which is <hi>Capiat qui capere poteſt;</hi> and this is truly a very unequal partition, for thoſe who ſtay in Arms upon the Wall, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the Market-place, to make them good againſt any oppoſition may ariſe from hidden Reſerves of the Enemy, ſhare not ſo well as thoſe, who ſo ſoon as they<note place="margin">Plunder.</note> enter, run preſently to the Plunder. Some Princes and Generals give the Pillage of Towns, taken by ſtorm, to their Armies for ſo many hours, ſometimes for a day, for two days, or three days. It is commonly thought, the Priſoners
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:97406:171"/> and their ranſomes belong to thoſe who took them, and ſo it is commonly practis'd, unleſs they be great Officers, and thoſe ſhould be deliver'd to the General, yet that General ſhould be ſo generous as to beſtow ſome handſome Preſent or gift on thoſe who took them, which ſome do, but many do not. The Ordnance, and all that belong to it, all publick Magazines of Proviſions, Munitions, and Arms belong to the Prince or State who manageth the War.</p>
                  <p>But if all Aſſaults be beat off, and all the Beſiegers have done hath prov'd ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsleſs, or that the beſieging Army is waſted, as no doubt, it will diminiſh<note place="margin">Beaſons to leave a Siege, and retire.</note> every day, or that a numerous and freſh ſuccourſe be expected, or other unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py accidents fall out; then a wiſe General will raiſe his Siege in time, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther march away, than be chac'd away, and he ſhould go where he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh and recruit; and be wiſe by the examples of thoſe otherwiſe renown'd Princes and Generals, who have obſtinately continued Sieges, to their irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable<note place="margin">Obſtinacy in continuing them loſeth Armies.</note> loſs and danger: So did <hi>Lautrec,</hi> a great Captain, continue the Siege of <hi>Naples,</hi> fighting againſt a redoubted and couragious Enemy within the City, and a contagious diſeaſe which rag'd within the bowels of his own Army, which occaſion'd firſt the loſs of his own life; ſecondly, the ignominious rout<note place="margin">Inſtances.</note> and deſtruction of all his Forces; and thirdly, the utter undoing of the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt in that Kingdom to this very hour.

So did that Emperours Great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> with a great deal of vanity, but with a greater deal of loſs, continue his Siege of <hi>Nuiſe</hi> as it were in deſpight of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, and all the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> till he was forc'd to ſneak away from it, with dammage and diſhonour enough. So did <hi>Rocandolf</hi> continue the Siege of <hi>Buda,</hi> notwithſtanding all the prayers and perſwaſions of all his great Officers to the contrary, to the utter undoing of a rich and a gallant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as hath been told you in another place.</p>
                  <p>But as in ancient times, ſo in our late <hi>European</hi> Wars, it hath been an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary<note place="margin">To raiſe a Siege without taking the place no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour.</note> thing for brave Generals to raiſe their Sieges, either upon the intelligence of the advance of a ſtrong ſuccourſe, or ſome other weighty conſideration. So did the great <hi>Guſtavus</hi> raiſe his Siege from <hi>Ingolſtadt</hi> in <hi>Bavaria:</hi> The <hi>Swediſh</hi> Felt-Marſhal <hi>Banier</hi> from <hi>Leipſick</hi> in <hi>Saxony:</hi> His Succeſſor <hi>Torſtenſon</hi> from <hi>Birn</hi> in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> and <hi>Wrangle,</hi> who ſucceeded him, from <hi>Eggar</hi> in <hi>Bohemia:</hi> So did<note place="margin">Inſtances.</note> 
                     <hi>Wallenſtein</hi> from the Sieges of both <hi>Magdeburg</hi> and <hi>Stralſund:</hi> So did Marqueſs <hi>Spinola</hi> raiſe his Siege from <hi>Bergen op Zoom,</hi> upon Count <hi>Mansfeld</hi>'s conjunction with <hi>Maurice</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and was not aſham'd to bury ſome of his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, that he might make his Retreat with more expedition: So did that ſame Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> raiſe the Siege he had form'd at <hi>Groll,</hi> upon <hi>Spinola</hi>'s advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. And ſo did his Brother <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> riſe from <hi>Venlo,</hi> upon the approach of the Cardinal <hi>Infant.</hi> But if a General be well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and there is no ſickneſs in his Army, and if he have ſtrong hopes to<note place="margin">To march from a beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Fort to fight an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, hazzar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous.</note> carry the place, he ought not to leave it, unleſs it be to fight the ſuccourſe that is coming to it. This hath been often practis'd, ſometimes unfortunately, and ſometimes ſucceſsfully. Take a few inſtances of both. Count <hi>Tili</hi> left the Siege of <hi>Leipſick,</hi> march'd toward the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who came to relieve the Town, and fought him, but to his great loſs: So did the Duke of <hi>Weymar,</hi> and the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Felt-Marſhal <hi>Guſtavus Horne</hi> leave the Siege of <hi>Nordling,</hi> and march'd<note place="margin">Inſtances.</note> to fight the <hi>Hungarian</hi> King, but with the loſs of the day, and their Army too. But that ſame Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> had afterwards better fortune when he beſieg'd <hi>Briſac,</hi> from the Siege whereof he roſe twice, and fought the Armies that were ſent to relieve the Town, and return'd both times to the Siege, crown'd with Laurel. So did the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army leave the Siege of <hi>Hameln,</hi> (that Town out of which they ſay a Piper plaid firſt all the Rats, and next all the Children, and of the laſt none returned) and met the Imperial Army which advanc'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, and ſought with Victory. So did the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> leave the Siege of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> not many years ago, and fight <hi>Don Juan d'Auſtria,</hi> and beat him.</p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:97406:171"/>
                  <p>But if the Beſieging Army be well, and ſtrongly entrench'd againſt an Enemy<note place="margin">To lye ſtill entrench'd notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any ſuccourſe.</note> both within and without the Town, and want for no proviſions, he ſhould make no ſuch hazzard, but lye ſtill, and when a ſuccourſe comes, it muſt either look on, and leave the attempt, or ſtorm the Beſiegers fortified Camp. If the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe be forc'd to march back without doing his errand, then the Beſieger is maſter of the Town or Fort. So did the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> when he beſieg'd <hi>Mons</hi> in <hi>Henault,</hi> keep himſelf within his fortified Camp, and endur'd all the brava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does of <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who came with an Army out of <hi>Germany</hi> to relieve the Town, the Duke knowing well that the Prince for want of Money would in a ſhort time be forc'd to disband his Army. If he who comes with the ſuccourſe, reſolves to ſtorm the Beſiegers fortified Camp, he doth it with as<note place="margin">To ſtorm an entrenched Camp often unſucceſsful.</note> much diſadvantage as an Army without ſhelter can fight with one that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd, and ſeldome ſuch attempts are ſucceſsful. <hi>Hannibal</hi> try'd it at the Siege of <hi>Capua,</hi> and though he did it both skilfully, cunningly, and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, yet after he had ſtorm'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, and was beat off, he was forc'd to leave that rich and great City to be a prey to its exaſperated Enemy. Count <hi>Pappenheim,</hi> though a brave Captain, yet gave cauſe to queſtion his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion very much, when he was ſo laviſh of his Maſter, the Emperours Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (at a time when he had ſo much need of them againſt the Victorious King of <hi>Sweden</hi>) as to ſtorm the fortified Camp of <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> at <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> where he left not ſo few as 1500 dead men on the place, beſides as many more who were wounded. The Prince followed a precedent was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by <hi>Spinola,</hi> when he beſieg'd <hi>Breda,</hi> who kept himſelf within his Trenches conſtantly, when firſt <hi>Maurice,</hi> and then <hi>Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> offered him Battel, and beat off likewiſe ſome aſſaults more made on ſome places of his Camp, by that ſame Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> and Sir <hi>Horatio Vere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When an Army that hath attempted the relief of a Town hath retir'd, and is either baffled or beaten, the Governour of the beſieged place may with repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation<note place="margin">Of rendition.</note> yield on honourable conditions, which will not be ſo good as they would have been before; but be what they will, they ought to be punctually and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably kept; but of this I ſhall ſpeak in another place. If a Beſieger obtain a Victory over the Army that comes to relieve the beſieged place, ſome think<note place="margin">To drive Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to the Port of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged Town.</note> he may drive all his Priſoners to the Ports of the Town, and if the Governour will not take them in, he may ſuffer them to ſtarve. But I can find no reaſon why the Governour ſhould admit them, and far leſs why the Victorious Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſhould have reſpited their lives from the Sword, to put them to a more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs Death; yet I ſaw ſome part of this practis'd at that Town of <hi>Hammeln,</hi> whereof I ſpoke but juſt now; for after the defeat of the Imperial Army, the <hi>Swediſh</hi> General ſent all the Priſoners (who were no fewer than three thouſand) to the Ports of the Town, but the Governour gave entrance to none of them. But, I conceive, this was done only to frighten the Garriſon out of the thoughts of further reſiſtance, and to give them within, aſſurance that their Friends were defeated, and not to ſtarve thoſe poor Creatures. But the matter came not to the tryal, for next day the Governour ſought a Parley, and got it, and then made an accord, got Articles fair enough, and gave over the Town.</p>
                  <p>The ſeveral works that are without the Ditch of a Royal Fortification muſt<note place="margin">The ſeveral kinds of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works.</note> be taken notice of ſo much, that it will be neceſſary for a Beſieger to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf maſter of them, before he make his approaches to that ſide of the Fortreſs, on which any of theſe outer works are. Engineers ordinarily make five kinds of them; theſe are, Half-Moons, Ravelines, Horn-works, Crown-works, and Tenailles; ſome add a ſixth kind, Traverſes. The manner to take them is the ſame I have already deſcrib'd, only I add, that it will be ſitting (if poſſible) to take away the Water out of thoſe Moats that are not dry, for the ground of Water-Ditches often proves muddy, yet the mud is ſooner made paſſable with Faſcines, than water is. It is true, if the Ditch be any thing deep, after the Water is away, you muſt have Ladders to deſcend at the Counterſcarp, but theſe may help you to aſcend the Scarp, or the <hi>Fauſſe Bray,</hi> if the Fort have one. The taking away Water from a Ditch is very ordinary, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable<note place="margin">To draw Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from a Ditch.</note> by any Engineer, if there be a deſcending ground from any part of the Moat.</p>

                  <p>But notwithſtanding all hath been ſaid, he who leads an Army, if he find none of theſe works without the Counterſcarp to retard him, and the place it ſelf either is not well fortified, or ſcarce of Men and Munition, or thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are timorous, or do not well agree among themſelves, or that by his Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he hath learned that the Governour is either not experienced, not vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or is a man of little Authority or Courage, after his firſt ſummons (by the anſwer whereof he may gueſs at the Governours reſolution) he may, to ſave his Maſter much expence, and himſelf and his Army much time and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,<note place="margin">To ſtorm without Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</note> ſo ſoon as he arrives make Batteries, and after a furious Cannonading, fill up the Moat as well as he can, eſpecially if it be a dry one; clap Ladders to the Wall, and his Souldiers being well refreſh'd and encourag'd, hazzard a ſtorm with probability enough of ſucceſs: But on the other part, if the place be well mann'd, (though the Fortification be none of the beſt) and commanded by an<note place="margin">Inconſiderate aſſaults ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</note> active and experienced Governour, who hath good Officers under him, and wants for neither Meat, Artillery, Arms, or Munition, it is but high preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, or rather madneſs, to give an Aſſault without theſe previous Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, Breaches and Zaps, whereof I have ſpoke. The late King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> a very martial Prince, blemiſhed his reputation in Military affairs by his inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſtorming <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> in which was the <hi>Daniſh</hi> King with all his Family, many of the Nobleſs of <hi>Denmark,</hi> a good Souldiery, three thouſand Students well arm'd, and ſome thouſands of Burgeſſes, who were to fight manfully for all that could be dear to men on Earth. The event of this Aſſault was corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent to the attempt, for <hi>Charles Guſtavus</hi> was beat off with a great loſs of<note place="margin">Charles Guſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus.</note> both his Army and Honour. Nor was his Unkle <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> excuſable (though he was the <hi>Mars</hi> of his time) for ſtorming the Imperial General <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenſtein</hi>'s<note place="margin">Guſtavus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphus.</note> Camp at <hi>Nuremburg,</hi> ſtrongly fortified on a Hill, and who with his own and the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Forces, had as many men within his Leaguer as the King had without, yet was the Aſſault obſtinately continued almoſt a whole day, and as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely was the Camp defended by the <hi>Imperialiſts;</hi> inſomuch that the Hill ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be nothing but fire and ſmoke. The concluſion was, the King was beaten off, and forc'd to leave ſome thouſands of dead men on the place, and fill all the Lazaretto's of <hi>Nuremburg</hi> with thoſe who were hurt and wounded. This action of his proceeded from the great confidence he had in his fortune, and former ſucceſſes; but here ſhe turn'd her back and frown'd upon him, nor did ſhe ever ſmile on him afterward, for about three months after that he loſt his life at the Battel of <hi>Lutſen.</hi>

Nor do I know any better way than for a Governour ſtill to imagine he may be betray'd, and therefore to be conſtantly on his Guard, to truſt but few, and yet ſeem to truſt all: He ſhould have a wary eye (without ſeeming to be jealous) on all the Inhabitants of the place, upon the Officers and Souldiers of his Garriſon, eſpecially on ſuch as are known to be of revengeful, diſcontented, or avaritious Inclinations; and if he learn that there is any tampering between any one of them and an Enemy, he ſhould do well to proceed againſt them with juſt ſeverity, for that will prove to be <hi>poena ad paucos, terror ad omnes.</hi> If the Governour have any Intelligence at the Court of the Prince or State who are Enemies to his Maſter, or with the Secretaries of their Generals, it will be eaſie for him to learn what Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors he hath in his Garriſon, and to proceed accordingly againſt them. A good antidote alſo againſt the poiſon of Treachery, is neither to truſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ports nor Poſts of a Garriſon'd place conſtantly to one Officer, nor to one Company or Band of Souldiers, whereof I ſpoke in my Diſcourſe of Watches and Guards. It hath been of bad conſequence in all ages, and will be ever a temptation to all baſe and treacherous Souls to hatch treaſonable deſigns. The doing it ruin'd the late gallant Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and all his great actions,<note place="margin">The late Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi>
                     </note> whereby he went fair to have disburthen'd the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s head of the Crown of <hi>Naples,</hi> immediately after the unexemplified Rebellion of <hi>Maſanello;</hi> but the Duke's entruſting the ſeveral Poſts of that great City of <hi>Naples,</hi> conſtantly to the ſame Officers, encourag'd one of them to treat with the Count <hi>d'Ognati,</hi> and fell him that which was entruſted to him, when the Duke was reducing an inconſiderable Iſle without the City: this blaſted all his fair hopes, and ſhortly after loſt him his liberty.</p>
                  <p>I told you in the laſt Chapter, that Surprizal was the ſecond, and next to Treachery, the eaſieſt way to take fortified places. I ſpoke of ſeveral kinds of Surprizals; of any of which, if a Governour gets Intelligence, it is eaſie for him to render it ineffectual, with the great hazzard, if not the inevitable loſs of many of the intended Surprizers; but without Intelligence, a Scalado is prevented by Guards duly order'd and ſet, ſtrictly and ſeverely kept, and<note place="margin">Againſt a Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lado.</note> by the diligent going of Rounds either the circuit of the whole Fort, or from Poſt to Poſt: for a Scalado is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſoon perceiv'd by vigilant Sentinels and careful Rounds, and as ſoon are the Ladders thrown down, with thoſe who are upon them. So were the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s people uſed at <hi>Geneva</hi> ſeventy years ago, where the Inhabitants expecting no ſuch thing in time of Peace, kept but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry careleſs Watch. And when <hi>Spinola</hi> beſieg'd <hi>Breda</hi> in the year 1625. Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> his deſign to ſcale the Cittadel of <hi>Antwerp</hi> was utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by a more than half ſleeping Sentinel. In the next place, there will be<note place="margin">Againſt a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> no danger, for a Fort to be ſurpriz'd by Souldiers diſguis'd like Countrey peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if a vigilant Guard examine and ſearch narrowly all who enter the Ports, eſpecially in the mornings and evenings, which ſhould be done in all Frontier Garriſons; and the proper place for doing this is eight or ten paces without the Draw-bridge, where there ſhould be a great balk, laid traverſe the Streets,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:97406:173"/> tyed at each end by an Iron Chain to a Poſt made firm in the ground, and<note place="margin">A <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Reuter.</note> through that balk are great holes bored, through which are pales of Wood made faſt, and theſe ſharp at both ends, this denies acceſs to any, either Horſe or Foot, till it be open'd. And here likewiſe ſhould all Waggons and<note place="margin">Againſt Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons &amp; Carts.</note> Carts be ſearched, eſpecially if they ſeem to be loaden with Hay, Straw or Corn, through and in which Halberds ſhould be thruſt, for many times under ſuch coverts, arm'd men are carry'd in at Ports of fortified places. Neither ſhould any Cart or Waggon be ſuffer'd to ſtop on a Draw-bridge, for that is often done to hinder the drawing it up, till an Enemy lurking not far off, runs to the Port and ſurprizes it; and in ſuch a caſe, if the Portcullis (at which, for that purpoſe there ſhould conſtantly ſtand a Sentinel) be not very ſoon let down, an Enemy may underprop it with ſtrong Forks, ſhorter or longer, made purpoſely for that uſe.</p>
                  <p>If the Ports of a Town, Caſtle or Fort, be in the midſt of the Curtain, as they ſhould be, and ordinarily are, the Flanks of the neareſt Baſtions ſeem ſufficient to defend thoſe Ports from Petards, or any other manner of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal;<note place="margin">Againſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards.</note> yet ſome think that long and great pricks of Iron of five or ſix foot length, ſixt in the lower part of the Draw-bridge would do well, that when the Draw-bridge is drawn up, thoſe pricks ſtanding out may hinder Petards to be affix'd, as alſo that in the upper parts of the Gates and Ports loop-holes be made, pretty wide, out of which may be thrown Stones, Logs of Timber, and Granadoes againſt the Petardeers, or Water pour'd to quench the Petard, if it be already hung on. There are ſeveral other ways to be uſed againſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards, concerning which I refer you to Engineers and Gunners. But it were good to have within every Port a piece of Ordnance of a large Caliber, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly<note place="margin">A great piece of Ordnance within a Port.</note> charg'd with Cartridges, wherewith to welcome thoſe who firſt offer to enter, for one of thoſe unexpected Vollies doth often make an Enemy (who in all Surpriz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ls hath the half, if not more, of the fear) retire faſter than he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced. I knew an Enemy who had got over the Walls of a little Town in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> without oppoſition, and had advanc'd to the Market-place, where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving not above fifteen or ſixteen Musquetades, run over the Walls faſter than he enter'd. There be two general ways good againſt all manner of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizals.<note place="margin">Two defences againſt all Surprizals.</note> The one for the defence of Ports, that is, a Raveline before every Port defends it from all manner of Attacks and Enterprizers. The ſecond to defend Curtains and Bulwarks, if the Ditch be dry, a row of Palliſadoes plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the middle of it, ſecures the Wall, for theſe cannot be cut down ſo ſoon, but the Guards (unleſs they be all aſleep or drunk) will be ſufficiently alarm'd to receive an Enemy: If there be two Moats, and Water in both, a row of Palliſadoes between them ſecures the place; if there be but one, and Water in it, it ſhould not be full to the brink, for ſo Boats may eaſily tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport men, but they cannot deſcend with them, without being heard, and then they may be aſſured of a ſhrewd reception. But all this depends on the carefulneſs and watchfulneſs of the Guards, on which indeed doth principally depend the ſecurity and ſafety of the place.</p>
                  <p>To defend Forts againſt Blockades, or formed Sieges made by Approaches, there be ſix things requiſite; firſt, the fortification of the place, whether that<note place="margin">Six things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for a Fort againſt Sieges and Blockades.</note> be by Nature, or by Art, or both; ſecondly, Men; thirdly, Money; fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Victuals; fifthly, Ammunitions; ſixthly, all kind of Arms, Defenſive and Offenſive, therein comprehending Artillery. The firſt of theſe belongs to the Engineer, wherein I have no more skill than to tell my Reader, that he, or any who will ſtudy Fortification, will profit more by one leſſon taught by word of<note place="margin">Fortification.</note> mouth from an Engineer, than by twenty writ in a Book, and illuſtrated eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them by Figures. I ſhall ſpeak a word or two of every one of the other five neceſſaries for a Fort.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond requiſite is Men, of whom there ſhould be no more nor fewer than are able to maintain it. Horſe-men, if the Siege continue long, prove<note place="margin">Men.</note> burthenſome, yet in three caſes they may be made uſeful, firſt to make Sallies, both before and after the Beſieger makes his Approaches, till thoſe come ſo<note place="margin">Horſe-men how ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a Siege.</note> near, that Horſe dare not hazzard out; ſecondly, if there be a void ſtreet or Interval between the Houſes and the Rampart of the Fort, ſo broad that Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men can ride five or ſix in breaſt, they may be very ſerviceable to beat an
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:97406:173"/> Enemy out, after he hath come over the Wall confuſedly. This Interval all ancient Towns had, and they call'd it <hi>Pomaerium,</hi> for they had two of them, one before, or without, and another within the Wall. Thirdly, If the Horſes be called to the Shambles (which in Sieges is no extraordinary caſe) the Horſe-men may either have a Poſt given them to defend, or they may be divided among the Foot. When Count <hi>Nauſo</hi> (about one hundred and thirty years ago, an Imperial General, ſtorm'd <hi>Peronne,</hi> after a great breach made in the Walls of it, he was beat off by the <hi>French Gens d'arms</hi> belonging to the Lord <hi>Florenge,</hi> who left their Horſes, and in full Harneſs, with Pikes, Partizans and H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lberds, maintain'd the breach two hours till they were relieved. And I have ſeen my ſelf, Horſe-men alight from their Horſes to ſtorm with the Foot. The eſtimate of the number of the Foot for maintaining a fortified place againſt a Siege muſt be taken from the circuit of it: Some will have for every Bulwark of the greater Royal Fortification one thouſand Souldiers, and for the leſſer Royal eight hundred, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill beſides the Inhabitants, others four or five hundred Souldiers enough with the Citizens. But ſince we know not what the number of the Inhabitants will be, ſuch, I mean, as are able to bear Arms, or whether they may be truſted or not, we muſt caſt up our account without them. Some therefore will have for every ten foot of the circumference of the whole Fort ſix Souldiers, but others think one Souldier enough for two foot, and ſo five Souldiers for ten<note place="margin">How many men requiſite to maintain ten foot of ground.</note> foot of ground. If this calculation hold for all the out-works, Counterſcarp, and <hi>Fauſe bray,</hi> as well as for the Fort it ſelf, then it can hardly be deny'd me, that the whole Infantry of an Army Royal, will be few enough to maintain a leſſer Royal Fortification of ten Baſtions, commonly call'd a <hi>Decagon.</hi> But let us ſpeak only of the Fort it ſelf, and ſuppoſe it to be an <hi>Octogon,</hi> that is, a Town fortified with eight Baſtions, a greater number than which our late Engineers require not in regular Fortifications, though there be ſome to be ſeen of ten, ſome twelve, and ſome more Bulwarks. We are firſt to ſee of how many foot of circumference our <hi>Octogon</hi> will be. We ſhall appoint every Curtain of this Fort to be five hundred foot long (an Engineer may make it ſhorter or longer as he pleaſeth) by this account eight Curtains take four thouſand foot; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Flank ſhall have the allowance of one hundred foot, and there being ſixteen Flanks in our Fort, they require ſixteen hundred foot, for the face of every Bulwark ſhall be allowed three hundred foot, and there being ſixteen faces in the Fort, they muſt have four thouſand eight hundred foot. Add theſe three numbers 4000, 1600, and 4800, the aggregate will be 10400 foot. Allow then one Souldier to maintain two foot of ground of this Town, you ſhall need 5200 men. But if you will allow ſix Souldiers to every ten foot of ground, then you muſt have 6120 Foot Souldiers to maintain this <hi>Octogon,</hi> without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning<note place="margin">How many requiſite to defend an <hi>Octogon.</hi>
                     </note> any of its Out-works; and how neceſſary theſe be, I ſhall not offer to diſpute, ſince it is certain that the longer an Enemy can be kept from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Fort, he is at the greater loſs of time, men, munition, and expence, and conſequently the longer time is gain'd to the Prince or State, to whom the beſieged place belongs, to provide for its relief. But on the other hand, many Out-works require many men to maintain them, many men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much meat, and the ſhorter time meat laſts, the ſooner will the<note place="margin">Outer-works.</note> Fort give over: beſides, the mouldering away of men in Out-works hugely weakens the defence of the Fort it ſelf. Neither are theſe Out-works of an old date, if it be true, what Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> ſays, that <hi>Maurice</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> firſt added them to Fortification. I dare not believe this, for I ſuppoſe it is not above ſixty four years ſince <hi>Maurice</hi> was Captain General of an Army. But if the Inhabitants of this <hi>Octogon</hi> of ours be the Subjects of the Prince or State for whom the Fort holds out; and more eſpecially, if they be of that<note place="margin">Of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of a Fort.</note> ſame perſwaſion in matters of Religion with the Garriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Souldiers, then fewer Souldiers will ſerve, perhaps by half, for thoſe Burgeſſes within the Walls will fight ſtoutly for their Wives, Children, Goods and Liberties, which is <hi>pro aris &amp; focis.</hi> But if neither of theſe be, and that the Citizens are to be miſtruſted, the Governour hath to do with a double Enemy, an avow'd and open one without, and a ſecret, yet a certain one within: And therefore he had need of both more Men, and more ſtrict Watch; neither muſt he fail to diſarm theſe Inhabitants, and command them, for moſt part, to keep within doors;
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:97406:174"/> but in ſuch caſes Cittadels are ordinary. Theſe Fortreſſes, that are by nature ſtrong, as ſituated on a Hill, or flanked with ſome inacceſſible and ſteep Rocks, or helped by the nearneſs of ſome River or Marſh, beſides their arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Fortification, will need by a great deal, fewer men, and ſo be defended at a far leſs expence. The number of theſe Souldiers I ſpoke of is to be reckon'd without Officers, neither are you to imagine, that in ſtorm or aſſault all the<note place="margin">How Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers ſhould fire from a Parapet.</note> Souldiers are to be drawn up in one Rank or row, on the Bulwarks or the Curtains; for at that rate, two foot being allowed to every man, none of them ſhould have room to handle their Arms; neither ſhould their giving fire be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive as it ſhould be. In time of ſtorm Souldiers appointed for the guard of a Poſt ſhould be drawn up three deep, or in three Ranks, that when one Rank hath given fire over the Parapet, it may deſcend, and the ſecond mount the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank, and after it the third.</p>
                  <p>The third thing requiſite for a beſieged place is Money, and ſo long as there<note place="margin">Money.</note> is Money to pay the Garriſon, and meat and drink to buy for that Money, the publick Magazines of Proviant ſhould not be touched, and for this reaſon many Governours cauſe Braſs to be coyned, ſome Leather, and order it to paſs for currant Money, engaging thereafter to give good coyn for it: So did <hi>Toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> forty years ago, when he was beſieged in <hi>Caſal,</hi> by the famous Marqueſs <hi>Spinola.</hi> Yet a Governour ſhould always reſerve, if he can, a ſtock of Money unſpent for all accidents, as knowing the difficulties of the Siege will encreaſe with time: for though loyalty, duty, reputation, good words, and hopes, prevail frequently with Souldiers to ſtand out againſt all hardſhips and difficulties manfully, yet, as the <hi>French</hi> ſay, <hi>Argent faict tout,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Great uſe for it in Sieges.</note> Money doth all. Intelligence is bought with Money, fellows will be hir'd with Money to go through the ſtricteſt, cloſeſt, and beſt guarded approaches, and this is ordinarily done in time of a Sally made for that purpoſe; and if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencer have agreed with the Governour concerning the preciſe time of his return, another Sally is made for his reception. At the time of a deſperate Sally, at the reparation of a dangerous breach, at the work of Retrenching in time of a furious Cannonade, or when an Aſſault is aſſuredly expected, a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſs of Money, with large promiſes of more, hath a wonderful influence upon the hearts of Souldiers. Nor ſhould a Governour ſpare, in time of want, to<note place="margin">A Governour may borrow from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</note> borrow from the Inhabitants; for if they be diſaffected, he may force them to lend, and if they be friends, it will not be time for them to hoard up their Moneys, when they are in danger to loſe all, as the unhappy <hi>Conſtantinopolitans</hi> did when Sultan <hi>Mahomet</hi> took their City by aſſault.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and fifth things requiſite for a Garriſon are Munitions of War,<note place="margin">Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> and Arms. Powder, Match and Ball ſhould be frugally husbanded, or freely ſpent, according to the quantity and ſtore, wherewith the Fort is provided: It ſhould not be laviſhed away in the beginning of the Siege, nor ſhould it be ſpared in the time of Zaps, Batteries, Galleries and Aſſaults, but no needleſs waſte ſhould be made of it in all or any of theſe; for this purpoſe a conſiderable Magazine of Ammunitions ſhould be put in all Forts, eſpecially in frontier Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, where the attack of an Enemy is ſooneſt expected; for many times to ſupply this want, great hazzards are run to convoy Horſe men into the beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged place, who carry leather bags full of Powder on the croups of their Horſes. Our Fort ſhould likewiſe be provided with all manner of Arms, Defenſive and Offenſive, Pikes, Half-Pikes, Halberds, Partizans, two-handed Swords, Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens<note place="margin">Arms.</note> Swords, Morning-Stars, with all manner of Fire-works and Hand-Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, for reſiſting a ſtorm, againſt which there ſhould be prepared alſo huge balks and logs of Timber, tyed to Poſts with Ropes or Chains, to let fall over, and pull up again: for theſe (as likewiſe a great number of greater and leſſer Stones) do good ſervice in time of Aſſaults, when an Enemy is mounting either the Curtain or Bulwark, and cannot be reach'd by ſhot unleſs from the Flanks, which for moſt part are made uſeleſs by the Enemies Cannon before the Aſſault. We read, even ſince the invention of Powder, what uſe our Anceſtors made of molten Lead, ſcalding Water, and boyl'd Oyl in time of Aſſaults, at which <hi>Louis de Montgomery</hi> in his <hi>French</hi> Milece makes good ſport, and ſays, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants had as good throw handfuls of Aſhes at their Enemies: But I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Louis de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery</hi> his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</note> of his opinion; for though experience were ſilent, both reaſon and ſenſe
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:97406:174"/> do teach us, that Fire doth more hurt than Aſhes, and is not burning fire in all theſe I ſpeak of? Scalding Water no queſtion doth miſchief, and may be us'd with no other expence than fire, but Lead and Oyl are chargeable, and may, I think, be employed for better and more proper uſes.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth and laſt, but not the leaſt requiſite and neceſſary thing for a beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged<note place="margin">Munitions for the mouth.</note> place is Munitions for the mouth, without which all the reſt ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. What ſeveral proviſions of meats and drinks (preſuppoſing there be Water enough in the Fort) are neceſſary for a Garriſon, I have told you in the eighth Chapter, where I have diſcourſed of Proviant. The queſtion is now, what quantity of them ſhould be ſtored up in a Garriſon that apprehends a Siege. There be ſome who think that ſix months proviſion is enough, and<note place="margin">For how long time a Town ſhould be provided with meat and drink.</note> of theſe <hi>Louis de Montgomery</hi> is one, becauſe, ſay they, in that time either the Winter ſeaſon will force the Beſieger to remove, or the relief of the place will be attempted by him to whom it belongs. But we have ſeen in our own times the contrary of both, though we had never heard of the Siege of <hi>Troy.</hi> Others ſpeak of three years proviſion, and this doth well; but the Governour when he is not beſieged, ſhould every year lay in one years freſh proviſions, cauſing the Souldiers to eat and pay for that which is oldeſt. I believe none will deny but a Garriſon ſhould be provided with meat and drink for one whole year at leaſt: And no ſooner ſhould a provident Governour foreſee or apprehend a Siege (whereof he may have many grounds for a probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture) but he ſhould command all the Inhabitants to provide themſelves of a<note place="margin">Citizens to provide a years <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> whole years food and maintenance, that his publick ſtores may be preſerv'd for the Souldiery, and all Citizens who are either unable or unwilling to do ſo, as alſo all unneceſſary people ſhould be commanded to remove out of the Town or Fort.</p>
                  <p>But after a place is inveſted, and the Siege formed, it is, I think, an act of inhumanity to thruſt out the Inhabitants, eſpecially if they have not had time to provide themſelves, yea, I think, it is more mercy to cut their throats with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, than to ſend them out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is not to be thought that an Enemy will ſuffer them to paſs, but will force them back to the Town-Ditches, where they may lamentably languiſh and ſtarve to death. Such an action as this, in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was an eternal blemiſh to the reputation of <hi>Monluc,</hi> that famous Marſhal of<note place="margin">A mercileſs act of Marſhal <hi>Monluc<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>France,</hi> who, after <hi>Sienna</hi> (whereof he was Governour) had been ſtrictly beſieged, ſhut out of the City four thouſand Inhabitants, Men and Women, young and old: The Marqueſs of <hi>Martignan,</hi> who commanded the Emperours and <hi>Coſmo di Medici</hi>'s forces, cauſed all theſe miſerable wretches to be chaced back to the Ditches; <hi>Monluc</hi> would receive none of them within the Town: Some luſty ſtrong fellows broke through <hi>Martignan</hi>'s Trenches, and eſcap'd; many Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Maids were privately (contrary to the Marqueſs his command) taken into Tents and Huts, to ſatiate the luſt of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but there dyed of them of meer hunger near three thouſand. Upon this woful occaſion the ſame <hi>Monluc</hi> in his Commentaries hath this expreſſion: <hi>Theſe are,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the mercileſs laws of War, we muſt be many times cruel to diſappoint our Enemies: God be merciful to us for doing ſo great miſchief.</hi> Indeed he had reaſon to cry for Gods mercy for committing ſo horrible a wickedneſs. But in what <hi>Codex</hi> did he read of ſuch a Law of War? Nay, where did he hear of ſuch a cuſtome of War? Strange it was in him to expel and expoſe thoſe to a mercileſs death, whom he nor none elſe had appointed to provide for a Siege, and whom he might have expell'd before the Siege was form'd, that they might have ſhifted for themſelves, or begg'd through <hi>Italy</hi> for bread. If ever there was a precedent for this, it was not to be imitated by one who profeſſed the name of Chriſt. And that which made this action of his altogether inexcuſable was, that he expected no ſuccours,<note place="margin">And altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable:</note> for after he was forc'd to yield the Town, wherein many of thoſe Citizens whom he permitted to ſtay, were conſum'd with Famine, and the remnant of his Souldiers ſo hunger-ſtarved that they look'd like Skeletons: He confeſſeth in the firſt Tome of his Commentaries, That he could never think of what he did, but with a ſad affliction of ſpirit for his folly, (he ſhould have ſaid, vanity and arrogance) in reducing that noble City, and his own Souldiery, to the laſt morſel of Bread; and ſubmitting them to the mercy of an incenſed Enemy, when he knew well enough that his Maſter, <hi>Henry</hi> the Second of <hi>France,</hi> was
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:97406:175"/> neither able to relieve him at that time, nor deſirous he ſhould bring himſelf and the City to thoſe extremities.</p>

                     <hi>Reinach,</hi> Governour of <hi>Briſac,</hi> in the year 1638 had a great deal more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<note place="margin">Briſac.</note> to keep out that ſtrong Town to the very laſt againſt the Duke of <hi>Weimar,</hi> ſince he knew his maſter the Emperour, would uſe all means under Heaven to relieve a place that was of ſo great a concern to the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> yet did he ſhut no Inhabitants out of it, after it was beſieg'd. This <hi>Briſac,</hi> for the famine it ſuffer'd during that Siege, was an Epitome of the miſeries of <hi>Samaria</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the <hi>Holy Land;</hi> and of <hi>Sancerre</hi> and <hi>Rochel</hi> in <hi>France. Caeſar</hi> in his <hi>Gallick</hi> War tells us, with a great abhorrency of the fact, That when he had reduced <hi>Vercengentorix</hi> and his <hi>Gauls</hi> to great want within <hi>Aleſia,</hi> at a<note place="margin">Aleſia.</note> Council held by the beſieged, one of the prime men among them propoſed, that all the old and unſerviceable people of the Town ſhould be kill'd, and preſerv'd for food to thoſe who were able to work and fight. But the proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the belly, be they great or ſmall, ſhould be ſparingly meaſur'd out after the publick ſtore-houſes are once broke up.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia;</hi> or to be read of in any Books except Romances. He muſt, ſay they, have an univerſal knowledge of Fortification and Gunnery, he muſt be very wiſe, of a ready<note place="margin">A no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This ſeems to be enough, but there muſt be more, he muſt be an old experienced Captain, and one who hath given good proof that he can both take and defend fortified places. This is a very ſtrange qualification, for if a man be not admitted to be a Governour, unleſs he have been one before, he ſhall never be one in his life. It needs therefore to be reſtricted thus, he ſhall not be choſen to be Governour of a frontier Town, or a Royal Fortification, unleſs he have formerly well defended ſome Fort or Caſtle of leſſer importance.<note place="margin">The real qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications he ſhould have.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth is, much of the ſafety of the place depends on the Governour, and therefore he ſhould be no Novice in Military affairs; but for all that, he ſhould not be an old man, for age waſtes that natural vigour which is requir'd in a man of his charge, and makes him unable for that fatigue which he is obliged to undergo. As to his experience, I think it is enough if he have been at two or three Sieges, and within one or two beſieged places, provided he be of a quick apprehenſion and judgement, for ſuch a one will learn more at one ſight than others will do at twenty. He ſhould underſtand the general rules of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and Gunnery, he ſhould be of a jocund, and jovial humour; for when Souldiers who are beſieged look on their Governour, and ſee him ſullen, who perhaps naturally is ſo, they fancy he is conſcious of ſome defects, weakneſs, or danger, whereof they know nothing. He ſhould be very couragious, and though he be bound to ſave himſelf from all needleſs dangers, yet in aſſaults he ſhould not be ſhy to expoſe his perſon to the moſt eminent perils; for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence doth exceedingly animate thoſe who are hazzarding their lives in that piece of ſervice. If this be true, as I believe it is, then thoſe are miſtaken,<note place="margin">A Coward a had Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> who think a Coward a fit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> perſon to be a Governour, becauſe his conſtant fear will make him conſtantly vigilant, but to what purpoſe his vigilance, when two or three hours Battery of Cannon ſhall terrifie him to a ſurrender? An opiniator our Governour ſhould not be, but ready both to ſeek and follow the advice of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:97406:175"/> his Captains, Engineers, and Gunners; and yet of that judgement, that he may of himſelf conclude the advice that is given him to be rational. It is fitting he have two or three or more Engineers with him, for ordering Retrenchments,<note place="margin">Engineers and Gunners.</note> and inventing new Defences, Engines and Machines, according to the emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of the Siege. Good Gunners and Cannoneers he ſhould have in the Fort, who have skill to make Batteries, Counter-batteries, and ſunk Batteries, and to diſmount the Enemies Ordnance. And if there be more Regiments than one in the Garriſon, it were fit the Colonels, Lieutenant Colonels and Majors, were men of good underſtanding and experience, that if either the Governour, or any of them chance to dye (which frequently falls out) thoſe who ſucceed to them by their antiquity or priority of place, may be endued with thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications that are ſuitable to their truſt and charge.</p>
                  <p>Being ſatisfied with the qualifications of the Governour, and thoſe who are to aſſiſt him, let us in the next place take a view of thoſe duties he owes, and is bound to perform in the time of a Siege. Before the danger be near, he<note place="margin">Duties of a Governour.</note> ſhould deſtroy all the Suburbs (for thoſe are the Cut-throats of Fortreſſes) all Mills, Houſes of pleaſure, Trees, Yards, Gardens, Barns, Encloſures, Hedges, or any thing elſe, under, or by which he conceives an Enemy may be ſhelter'd, or make his Approaches more eaſie. And this he ſhould do betimes, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Enemies arrival all within two hundred paces of the Counterſcarp, may be an <hi>Eſplanad;</hi> for truly when the beſieging Army advanceth near the Town, I<note place="margin">To make all plain without the Fort.</note> know not what good it is, or can do, to burn houſes, which indeed is quickly done, but the Walls of thoſe Houſes ſtanding, gives as good and as eaſie ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though not ſo good an accommodation, as the Houſes did. Next, the Governour is to divide all his men into ſeveral Poſts, allowing ſo many to the<note place="margin">To divide it in ſeveral Poſts.</note> defence of each, according to the ſtrength or weakneſs of the place, changing nightly if he can, for fear of Treachery: withal, he ſhould keep a ſtrong Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve conſtantly in the Market-place, to make uſe of as he ſhall think fit to give direction. At the beginning of the Siege he is to diſcharge all private Parleys<note place="margin">To diſcharge private Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys.</note> and Diſcourſes with thoſe who are without; ſome diſcharge all Songs and Whiſtlings, the ſtriking of Clocks, and ringing of Bells, that thereby no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſigns or advertizements formerly agreed on, may be given. He is bound<note place="margin">To ſpare the Souldiers from unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary toil.</note> to ſpare his Souldiers from toyl and fatigue as much as poſſibly he may; and it is well if he can order the matter ſo that they may watch one day, work the ſecond, and reſt the third.</p>
                  <p>If the Governour have Horſe in his Garriſon, when the Enemy advanceth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, he may ſend them out, with foot behind to ſuſtain them, to make<note place="margin">Sallies.</note> ſome light skirmiſhes, and to bring back with them Priſoners, if they can. But before the Approaches be advanc'd, ſo long as an Enemy is freſh, and in great Bodies, Sallies do him ſmall or no hurt, and the loſs of one man of the Beſieged doth the Governour more hurt and prejudice, than the loſs of ten can do the Beſieger. Sallies are neceſſary then, when they are undertaken to<note place="margin">When neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</note> hinder the making, or the finiſhing of a Battery; or if made, to ruine it, or to hinder the progreſs of a Zap, or to nail Ordnance or Mortars. Sallies ſhould be reſolutely made, and the Retreat from them orderly: In the time of them, the Ordnance from the Baſtions of the Town ſhould play luſtily upon the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches where the Salliers are not, and over all the Approaches upon the Fields, to hinder ſuccourſe to come from the leaguer or quarters; and feints made at other Ports of the Town, as if the Beſiegers were to Sally out of them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Thoſe who Sally, will not do well to amuſe themſelves with taking ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">To take few Priſoners a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What Priſoners you carry into a beſieged place, you muſt reſolve to entertain them (for back you muſt not ſend them) and guard them, that they eſcape not, this will be both burthenſom and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom to you, and to allow them no maintenance is inhumanity: And this was the Governour of <hi>Briſac</hi>'s fault, for which he was like to pay dear, as you may hear in the next Chapter. If by a Sally the Beſiegers be beat out of a Battery, the Pieces of
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:97406:176"/> Ordnance and Mortars that are in it, ſhould be immediately cloy'd and nail'd;<note place="margin">What is to be done in the time of a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> or if the Sallyers have ſome time to put Powder under the platform, or a train with a burning match to the Powder Chamber, which is ordinarily beſide the <hi>Appareill,</hi> it may much endanger and endammage the Beſiegers, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to repoſſeſs their Battery. But a careful Enemy having Reſerves to attend all accidents, many times purſues the Sallyers ſo furiouſly in their Retreat, that the Beſieged are forc'd to ſhut their Gates againſt their own people; therefore it were not amiſs to have Ladders at the Counterſcarp, whereby they may deſcend to the Ditch, if it be dry, and ſo get into the Caſemates; but theſe are for moſt part left out in our lateſt Fortifications, I know not for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; or if there be Water in the Moats, in that caſe little Boats may receive thoſe Souldiers that cannot enter at the Sally Port. In all, or any of theſe Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, the Governour ought not to hazzard his perſon, or offer to ſtir out of his<note place="margin">A Governour not to ſally.</note> Fort, let the pretence be never ſo ſpecious or plauſible. I know many gallant men have done it, to their irrecoverable loſs.</p>
                  <p>When a Governour perceives where an Enemy intends to batter, or to lodge, whether it be in Curtain or Bulwark, he is oblig'd immediately to begin a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment behind the place aim'd at; but for all that, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e is to diſpute that<note place="margin">A Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</note> Curtain or Bulwark, or any part of them to the uttermoſt; he muſt defend it to extremity, by Sallies, Counter-batteries, by ſinking Cannon to deſtroy the Galleries, and by Counter-mines to blow up thoſe who lodge in the breaches; and if he muſt quit it, he is to do it by inches. But all this while the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is buſie working at his Retrenchment, that when he is forc'd to part with that for which he hath fought ſo well, he may retire his men to his Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, where the Beſiegers ſhall have a new work to begin. A Retrenchment<note place="margin">What it is.</note> is a new line, as regularly drawn, and fortified with Flanks, as the conveniency of the place may permit: It is made up of ſtone, earth, rubbiſh, boards, balks and planks, feather-beds, woollen or ſtraw ſacks, dung, or what can be had, whereof ſtore ſhould be provided before hand. If there be ground enough for it between the Rampart and the Town it is well; if not, as many Houſes, owe them who will, muſt be pull'd down, as may ſerve the turn. The Ancients uſed<note place="margin">Called a Countermure.</note> theſe Retrenchments frequently, and call'd them <hi>Countermures:</hi> The <hi>Germans</hi> call them <hi>Abſueid,</hi> that is, a cutting off; becauſe by it they cut off the reſt of the Fort from that part the Enemy hath taken. Many times they are made in a very ſhort time, and ſo they may in a Town where no ſerviceable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is exempted from work, young nor old, man nor woman, except whom childhood or old age, or ſickneſs excuſeth. Yet, I think, that which <hi>Monluc</hi> writes concerning a Retrenchment is very ſtrange: He ſays, he was in <hi>Henry</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Great celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> the Second of <hi>France</hi> his time, with the Count of <hi>Briſac,</hi> at the Siege of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> called <hi>Courteville,</hi> where by a continued Battery of twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſhot of Cannon in the ſpace of twenty four hours, the Wall was ſo beat down that the <hi>French</hi> went to ſtorm, which when they did, they ſaw oppoſite to them a Countermure as ſtrong as the Wall, made up in the time of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. Yet <hi>Monluc</hi> by his own relation, took longer time himſelf to make a Retrenchment at <hi>Sienna,</hi> where he had a great deal of more hands to work than can be imagin'd could be got in any Caſtle of <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if after all this care, diligence, and noble behaviour of the Governour<note place="margin">What to be done at a ſtorm.</note> and his Garriſon, the Beſiegers ſhall give a general ſtorm to the Fort, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and all his Souldiery having made preparation before-hand for a gallant reſiſtance, he and they are to carry themſelves ſo manfully in the Aſſault that the Enemy may be beat off; but if that cannot be, he and his Garriſon may either dye like men, or if they be taken Priſoners, they may out-live their misfortune with honour and reputation.</p>
                  <p>Next to that of a Captain General, there is not a more tickliſh charge in the whole Military employment, or that requires more caution in accepting, than this of a Governour; for on his good and happy, or bad or misfortunate deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Private capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Prince and a Governour of a Fort.</note> depends the Prince his ſervice, his own reputation, the welfare or ruine of the place, or perhaps the whole Countrey where the Fortreſs is ſituated: and therefore a perſon of honour ſhould be ſhy to engage in it; or if the obedience he owes to the abſolute command of his Prince, or his General, force him to
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:97406:176"/> accept it, he ſhould do it on conditions ſecretly agreed on, to which few or none but the Prince of his General ſhould be privy. The conditions may be ſuppos'd to be ſuch as theſe which follow.</p>
                  <p>If the place be well fortified, after either the ancient or later way of Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cation,<note place="margin">The ſuppoſed conditions of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But if there be any defect in theſe or any of theſe, then the private conditions ſhould be; Firſt, How long he ſhall be bound to hold out.<note place="margin">Firſt. Second. Third.</note> Secondly, If he ſhall reject all ſummons and all proffers, till the Enemy hath fully form'd his Siege, and inveſted the Fort. Thirdly, If he ſhall hearken to no agreement, till the Enemy make his Approaches, and begin to make Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; for you are to obſerve, the Governour is to expect worſe conditions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Cannon hath play'd than before. Fourthly, If he ſhall endure the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,<note place="margin">Fourth.</note> Zap and Mine, and all this to give time for the Prince or his General to gather forces for the relief of the Fort. Fifthly, If the Governour ſhall be<note place="margin">Fifth.</note> obliged to hold out one ſtorm, and then capitulate, or more than one; for you are ſtill to imagine, that the nearer the Enemy draws to him, the worſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be offer'd him. Sixthly, How ſoon he may expect a ſuccourſe after<note place="margin">Sixth.</note> the Siege is form'd, that accordingly he may take his meaſures, and to ſave Men and Munition, may protract and gain time by counterfeited Parleys<note place="margin">Counterfeit parleys.</note> (a thing excellently well practis'd by Sir <hi>James Ramſay</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Hanaw,</hi> 1636 and -37.) in ſeeming to accept ſome offer'd conditions, but to require others which he knows will not be granted; but he muſt ſtill be ſure not to treat in earneſt, till ſome days after the expiration of the time of the promiſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief agreed on in the private capitulation between the Prince or his General, and the Governour. Seventhly, If the promiſed ſuccourſe come not at the<note place="margin">Seventh.</note> appointed time, as being hinder'd by thoſe inſurmountable difficulties which could not be foreſeen; whether then the Governour may not accept of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and by giving over the Fort, ſave his Maſters Artillery, Arms, Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Victuals? and if this cannot be granted him, whether he may not by the loſs of ſome of theſe, or all of theſe, ſave the lives of his Garriſon, by the beſt accord he can make? And laſtly, The Prince or his General ſhould exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Eighth.</note> condeſcend and agree with the Governour what Dumb Intelligence ſhall be given by ſigns by either party, that both may underſtand how all theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going tranſactions will be, or will not be performed, and what tokens ſhall be given in the day time and what in the night; as ſuppoſe ſo many ſhot of great<note place="margin">Dumb Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> Guns either in the day time or the night, ſhall ſignifie ſuch a thing; a great ſmoke made at ſuch a place in the day time ſhall intimate ſuch and ſuch a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; three, four or five ſhot of Cannon made at ſuch an hour of the night, or a Lanthorn with many lights let down ſo many times in the night time from a high Steeple ſhall denote the wants within the Fort, or perhaps the number of weeks and days the Governour is able to hold out; one, two, or three Fires made at ſuch a diſtance without, ſhall let the Governour know ſuch and ſuch things. They ſhould likewiſe agree concerning Intelligence to be ſent in or out by word of mouth or Letters: The laſt ſhould be writ in Cyphers, a Copy whereof both General and Governour ſhould have: The firſt ſhould be ſuch language as the Meſſenger himſelf ſhould not underſtand the meaning or ſenſe of it. In the punctual obſervation of all theſe the General and Governour ſhould be very wary and attentive.</p>
                  <p>But in my Diſcourſe of Intelligence, I told you how dangerous it is to truſt to any Intelligence, that by word of mouth may be reveal'd to an Enemy either<note place="margin">Letters dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</note> by the Treachery, or the confeſſion (preſs'd out by torture) of him who carries it. That by Letters may be reveal'd by the carriers fear or falſhood, and the Cyphers opened with a Key, or they may be betray'd by the Secretaries who wrote them. Next, a great perſons ſubſcription may be counterfeited, in which art ſome are very expert; neither is there any hurt in it, ſo they make not a bad uſe of their skill, and a Prince or a Generals Seal may be taken from ſome old Paſs, and clapp'd to a new Paper.

                     <hi>Spinola</hi> had read both, the firſt before he enter'd, and the ſecond after he came out of the Town, who thereby came to the knowledge of all their ſecrets; the Rogue was well rewarded by both parties. But after <hi>Maurice</hi> his death, this Bore reſolves to ſerve his Brother, Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> in the ſame faſhion, and to that end ſeem'd to be gain'd with much difficulty, and by much Gold, to carry the Prince his laſt Letters to the Governour: <hi>Henry</hi> wrote to him, that it was then purely impoſſible to raiſe the Siege, and deſir'd him at midnight to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge three pieces of Ordnance, and that thereafter by ſeveral fires on the great Steeple, he ſhould let him know how many days his Victuals would hold out. The Intelligencer went ſtraight to <hi>Spinola,</hi> who having read the Letter, and handſomely ſeal'd it up, diſpatch'd the faithful meſſenger to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who at the prefixed time made his three ſhots, and by eleven ſigns made by fire, let the Prince know he was able to ſubſiſt no longer than eleven days; which <hi>Spinola</hi> did as punctually obſerve as the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> did. In the time of that ſame Siege, at a Sally, a <hi>German</hi> Souldier was taken by the Count of <hi>Iſemberg,</hi> who treated his Countrey-man ſo well, that the fellow undertook to return to the Town, and come back to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Camp when the Victuals of the beſieged City grew ſcarce, which he did; and thereby <hi>Spinola</hi> had likewiſe a fair help given him how to take his meaſures.</p>
                  <p>If all endeavours, and all hopes fail, and that inexorable neceſſity force the<note place="margin">To yield on Articles.</note> Governour to yield, let him do it on the moſt honourable and advantageous terms he can; and let him be ſure to have his Articles ſign'd by him who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in chief; and if he can obtain it, let him get Hoſtages of quality ſent to ſome neighbour Garriſon, to lye there till all conditions agreed on be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Of Articles I ſhall ſpeak in the next Chapter.</p>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:97406:177"/>
                  <p>But if there be ſmall, or no hopes of ſuccours, it will not be fit for a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour<note place="margin">Obſtinacy in defending Forts hurtful,</note> to bring things to the laſt extremity, or ſtand out, where he cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably hope to reſiſt; for that expoſeth his men to Butchery, a thing very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable to God, and prejudicial to his Maſters ſervice. It is needleſs to illuſtrate this with examples, ſtory is full of them, and we have ſeen the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it in our own days. The <hi>Imperial</hi> Lieutenant General, Count <hi>Tili,</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>New Brandenburg</hi> (an inconſiderable Town) obſtinately defended by Major General <hi>Kniphauſen,</hi> and his <hi>Suediſh</hi> Garriſon, did at the ſtorm forbid all quarter (though he was known to be merciful enough) and after he had carried the Town by Aſſault, he told the Governour who was then Priſoner, That he could not uſe him worſe than ſend him to his Maſter, the King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> who, he thought, was oblig'd in Juſtice to hang him, for loſing him ſo many gallant men, by his vanity and arrogant reſiſtance. And truly, I think, to put a few<note place="margin">Eſpecially thoſe of ſmall importance.</note> men in an obſcure place, or a Caſtle of a mean Fortification, and command them to ſtand out againſt a well appointed Army, or that which ordinarily paſſeth under the name of an Army Royal, is to ſend them directly to the Shambles; for what General will ſuffer himſelf to be ſo affronted, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge it? When the <hi>French</hi> King, <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, march'd into <hi>Italy</hi> with<note place="margin">Inſtances.</note> a mighty Army, the Governour of a little ill fortified Caſtle in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> called <hi>Volane,</hi> made a Sally, and kill'd and plunder'd ſome <hi>French</hi> Baggage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: The Caſtle is ſummon'd, and refuſing to yield on honeſt conditions, it is inveſted, and forc'd to render on mercy, whereof they found but little in that ſevere Conſtable <hi>Anne de Montmorancy,</hi> who cauſed the poor Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and his Garriſon, to be hang'd every mothers ſon. Another Caſtle held out againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, when he retir'd to <hi>Italy,</hi> out of <hi>Provence,</hi> but being forc'd to yield, the Garriſon receiv'd the like uſage, every man of it being forc'd to end his life on a Gallows.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſometimes the condition of the War, and the circumſtances of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,<note place="margin">Yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Ratio Belli</hi> requires it.</note> that a Governour and his Garriſon ſhould rather fight to death, than accept of any agreement, and this is when time muſt be given for gathering or joyning of forces; or in a Retreat, to give a ſtop to an Enemies furious purſuit; and this <hi>Ratio Belli</hi> in ſuch caſes, hath <hi>Ratio Phyſica</hi> in the belly of it, for it is nothing elſe but Amputation, by cutting one member off to ſave the whole Body.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, to give over a fortified place without a Noble, and<note place="margin">To give over with ſmall, or no reſiſtance, puniſhable with death.</note> Souldier-like reſiſtance, is a crime which comes near to that of <hi>Treaſon;</hi> for it is indeed <hi>Tradere urbem in poteſtatem Hoſtis,</hi> To betray the Town into the power of the Enemy. And as it was with the Ancients, ſo it is yet puniſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with ſhameful death. <hi>Monluc</hi> tells us in his Commentaries, that <hi>Don Arbre,</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colonel, caus'd a Captain to be hang'd at the Bridge<note place="margin">Inſtances.</note> of <hi>Aſturia,</hi> a Town in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> without Proceſs or hearing him, for giving over a Caſtle without an Aſſault; and he ſays, he knew the like ſeverity uſed to others for crimes of that nature. In the year 1632. <hi>Guſtavus Adol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> took a Town in <hi>Bavaria</hi> called <hi>Reene,</hi> in two days time, and left a Colonel to be Governour there, who was beſieg'd ſhortly after, and kept out the Town eight days: But becauſe the King his Maſter thought he had given it over too ſoon, he caus'd his head to be ſtruck from his Shoulders. In the year 1636. <hi>Jane Deverth,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Imperial</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Generals, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed a great deal of <hi>Picardy,</hi> and burnt many Villages; at that time the Governour of <hi>Chaſtelet</hi> having abundance of all things requiſite to hold out a Siege, baſely gave it over, and though he ſav'd himſelf by flight, yet was he by the <hi>French</hi> Kings command, hang'd <hi>in eſſigi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Corvey,</hi> a very ſtrong place, was alſo cowardly given over to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who put a Garriſon into it, the Governour whereof deliver'd it back to the <hi>French</hi> ſooner than he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for which, ſo ſoon as he came to the firſt Town of <hi>Artois,</hi> where there was a Garriſon, he was commanded to alight from his Horſe, kneel at the Port, and without other Proceſs, had his Head ſtruck off by the hand of a Hangman. I remember that in the year 1637. the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Felt-Marſhal <hi>Banier</hi> garriſon'd the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Luneburg,</hi> which Caſtle they called <hi>Kalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> and appointed one Colonel <hi>Stammer</hi> to be Governour of it, who not

                  <p>Having diſcours'd thus far of the Defence of Towns and Forts, I ſhall tell my Reader, that ſome are pleas'd upon this ſubject to ſtart a queſtion, which is this, Whether all places which Princes and States intend to maintain with<note place="margin" type="runSum">A Queſtion ſtarted,</note> Garriſons, ſhould be fortified <hi>a-la-Modern,</hi> that is, according to the Modern Art of Fortification, with Curtains, Gorges, Faces, and Flanks of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, Fauſſe brays, Ditches, Counterſcarps, and Out-works? Or if a place fortified <hi>a l'antique,</hi> or the ancient manner, may without prejudice be kept and defended, as it is? There be reaſons <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con.</hi> But ſome judicious perſons, who have obſerv'd the practice of our Modern Wars in <hi>Europe</hi> theſe ſixty years by-paſt; eſpecially in the long <hi>German</hi> War, where many Forts were taken and re-taken, where many places only fortified in the ancient way, remain'd inexpugnable, notwithſtanding obſtinate Sieges form'd againſt them, having in them but ſmall Garriſons of Souldiers, aſſiſted by ſtout and reſolute Inhabitants; whereas other places of great importance, fortified with all the new inventions of Art, have either ſuddenly been taken by force, or ſoon brought to ſurrender on Articles. I ſay, they doubt not<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> to averr, That a Town which hath a ſtrong Stone Wall, (obſerve here, that the hardeſt Stone is ſooneſt breach'd) with Towers at a convenient diſtance one from another, with dry and deep Ditches; a good and firm Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp, without any Out-works (wherein men are irrecoverably loſt, to the great prejudice of the Fort) this Town, defended by a reſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently well experienced Governour, ſeconded by ſtout and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Souldiers and Burgeſſes, though not very numerous, may make as good and as long, if not a ſtouter and longer reſiſtance, than a Town fortified <hi>a-la-modern, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is true, thoſe Round Towers built on the Wall, in the ancient manner, cannot be well Flanked; but to that it is anſwer'd, that they do much hurt in Approaches, and are not batter'd down, but with a vaſt expence of Powder and Bullet; as alſo, that the Faces of the Modern Bulwarks, which take up much more than the third part of the whole Fortification, have no other Defences but from the ſecond Flanks, and thoſe are not very conſiderable.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XXVI.</hi> Of Priſoners, Parleys, Treaties, and of Articles, in our Modern Wars.</head>
                  <p>IN thoſe Battels, Retreats, Sieges and Defence of Towns, whereof we have ſpoken in the four preceding Chapters; there have been, no doubt, many Priſoners, many Parleys and Treaties made, and many Articles ſign'd, and therefore it is fit to ſpeak ſomething of them. In the twenty third Chapter of my Diſcourſes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Art of War, I have ſhewn you the manner of them among the Ancients; between which, and that uſed in the Modern War, we ſhall not find very eſſential differences. And firſt we ſhall ſpeak of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
                  <p>Impriſonment is one of thoſe ſeven external afflictions, which learned men<note place="margin">Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> ſay follow the humane nature, and may befal every particular man, how great ſoever he be. Emperours and Kings, yea, our Bleſſed Saviour, as he was Man, was not exempted from it. Men are made Priſoners, for crimes, for debts, and by chance of War; and it is of theſe I nam'd laſt, whereof I now diſcourſe. How thoſe ſhould demean or comfort themſelves, I leave to the directions of the Divine or Moral Philoſopher; only I ſhall ſay this, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may averr it to be true, That if Souldiers would accuſtome themſelves to be ſometimes alone, and learn to enjoy themſelves without other company, and have thoſe meditations they ought to have of their own mortal and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain condition, they would endure Impriſonment with greater patience, than thoſe can, who when they are at liberty, cannot live without ſociety and company; for he who can live pleaſantly and contentedly alone, will find a Priſon eaſie enough, if no other affliction be added to it.</p>
                  <p>We may divide all Priſoners of War into two Claſſes, of thoſe who are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<note place="margin">Priſoners of War, Divided into two Claſſes.</note> without any previous Treaty, and thoſe who have Articles. The firſt Claſs we may ſub-divide into thoſe who have quarter verbally promis'd them, and thoſe who ſubmit to the mercy of the Victor. Of all theſe, and each of theſe, I ſhall ſay one word in general, that though quarter be promis'd by inferiour Officers or Souldiers, or that the vanquiſh'd hoping for mercy, yield without any ſuch promiſe, he who commands in chief (provided he be on the place) may put all thoſe Priſoners to the Sword; for quarter given by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour ſignifies nothing till it be confirm'd by him who commands on the place, and then the Priſoners have quarter. That chief Commander may order them all to be kill'd, without any imputation of breach of Faith or Juſtice, as not being tyed by any promiſe his inferiour hath made; and this he may do by the Law of War, and that is grounded on the law and cuſtome of Nations; and if you will believe <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and the <hi>Ahtenians,</hi> it is grounded on the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by which Priſoners of War may be uſed as the Victor pleaſeth. And <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays, <hi>In Captivos quicquam impune fieri,</hi> and <hi>Captivi Jure Belli occidi poſſunt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral may do with Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of War.</note> Suppoſe ſtill, that no quarter hath been promis'd by him who commands in chief on the place. But though, I ſay, a General may do this by the Law of War, yet he cannot do it without the imputation of horrible cruelty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity, except in ſome caſes. And though <hi>Jure Belli</hi> they may be kill'd, yet without invincible reaſons, to kill men in cold blood is not the part of a man; for they caſt up their account, that the bitterneſs of death is paſt, and therefore they ſhould not be put to death, unleſs he who inflicts it, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as good a warrant for it, as he could who hewed the King of the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites</hi> in pieces, after <hi>Saul</hi> had given him quarter. The Heathen <hi>Tacitus</hi> could ſay, <hi>Trucidare deditos ſaevum;</hi> It is cruelty to kill thoſe who ſubmit. Yet you will<note place="margin">Cruelty to kill Priſoners in cold blood.</note> ſee anon that Chriſtian Priſoners of War have been put to death in cold blood by
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:97406:179"/> Chriſtian Princes and Generals, without any other Authority for their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing, than what the Law of War gave them.</p>
                  <p>But after Quarter is confirmed or granted by the General, the queſtion is, Whether upon the emergency of three ſeveral accidents, they may not be put to the Sword? The firſt is, if an Enemy rally after a Battle is won, and make,<note place="margin">Whether Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners may not be killed after Quarter given them by the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, In three caſes.</note> or offer to make a fierce onſet, the victorious Army not being ſo ſtrong to oppoſe the charge and guard the Priſoners, from whom alſo danger is to be expected; This was <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth of <hi>Englands</hi> caſe at <hi>Agencourt,</hi> where, for the ſame reaſons, 6000 <hi>French</hi> Priſoners by his order were in an inſtant put to the Sword.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Froiſſard</hi> paſſionately relates to us the ſad fate of about one thouſand <hi>French</hi> men, who were taken Priſoners, and had fair quarter given them by <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in a battle that he fought with one of his own name, King of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> the ſtory was briefly this, The King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> having a juſt pretence to the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> (to which in hatred of the <hi>Caſtillans,</hi> the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes</hi> had advanced a Baſtard) invades <hi>Portugal</hi> with a great Army, in which were many <hi>French</hi> Auxiliaries: The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> King being reinforced with a conſiderable number of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Archers, reſolves to fight. The <hi>French</hi> would needs have the point, which was given them with much indignation by the <hi>Caſtillans,</hi> who lag'd behind them at a very great diſtance. Theſe <hi>French</hi> valiantly fighting, are routed, and moſt of the thouſand I ſpoke of, are taken; thereafter the <hi>Caſtillans</hi> advanced with a reſolution to fight; the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> ſeeing he was to fight a new Battle, commanded under pain of Death, every man to kill his Priſoner, which was inſtantly performed with much pity and compaſſion, and not without the ſad tears of thoſe who maſſacred them.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond caſe is, when an Army is retiring, and a powerful Enemy fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſuing, it will be dangerous to leave your Priſoners behind you, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you can hardly bring them. And the third is, When you are reduced to great penury and want of meat, whether you had not better kill your Priſoners than let them ſtarve, for if you maintain them, they inſenſibly cut your throat by eating your bread. All theſe three caſes <hi>Grotius</hi> comprehends in theſe words, <hi>Si Captivorum multitudo oneri aut periculo ſit;</hi> If, ſayes he, the multitude of your Priſoners be dangerous or burthenſome, in theſe caſes he adviſeth rather to diſmiſs them, than kill them. I think he ſpeaks like a good Chriſtian; but I am afraid, that they who lead Armies will think by ſuch mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies they will prove cruel to themſelves, and treacherous to their Prince; and when in any of theſe caſes they are put to death, often their numbers occaſion their deſtruction, which in other caſes the ſame <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>otius</hi> would have to be the cauſe of their ſafety.</p>
                  <p>But the Prince or Generals promiſe of fair quarter admits <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a <hi>ſalvo,</hi> for noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious<note place="margin">To whom Quarter ought not to be given.</note> Thieves, Robbers, Murtherers, ſuch as have deſerted their ſervice and run over to the Enemy, or have broke their Oath of fidelity, ought not to be comprehended in this promiſe, nor can it ſave them from the ſtroke of Juſtice: Indeed if they get Articles ſigned for their lives, theſe Articles ſhould be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerved, for faith ſhould be kept to the worſt of men. Neither can the promiſe of Quarter ſecure Rebels from that death Rebellion deſerves; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſave them but the mercy of the Sovereign Prince or State, againſt whom the crime is committed: Yet my humble opinion ſhould be, That when<note place="margin">What to be done with Rebels.</note> Rebellion is come to that growth, that ſhe is not aſhamed to take her mask off, and that the ſucceſs of Rebels hath clothed them with uſurped Authority, Princes and States ſhould rather ſuffer Quarter (though without Articles) to be kept to thoſe of them who are taken Priſoners, than provoke them to ſhed the blood of loyal perſons on Scaffolds, as hath been done too oft; for it is not to be doubted, but Rebels will both by their Paper and leaden Bullets, vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate themſelves, and maintain their Authority to be lawful, and roar out theſe diſtinctions, which yet make our Ears tingle, of the Prince his virtual and perſonal power, of his legal and perſonal capacity.</p>
                  <p>Having told you, who hath power to give Quarter, and having ſpoken of<note place="margin">Priſoners who yield on diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</note> Priſoners who yield upon promiſe of Quarter, let us ſpeak next of thoſe who ſubmit to the Victors diſcretion, and have no promiſe of Quarter, who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly may be put to the edge of the Sword, without any imputation of breach
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:97406:179"/> of Faith or promiſe, yet not without the imputation of cruel inhumanity. They do not indeed tranſgreſs againſt the Laws of War nor Nations, who ſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their blood; but they ſin againſt humane nature, which commiſerates frailty, and againſt the Laws of Chriſt.

                     </hi>

To the firſt, to hold out gallantly, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, ſo long as there are any hopes of a Relief, is not a crime in it ſelf, but if accidentally a Garriſon have provoked the Beſieger to revenge, it will be<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwer to the firſt reaſon.</note> more gallantly done to refuſe all Parley, diſcharge all Quarter, and in the fury put all to the Sword, than to kill them in cold blood; yet it is frequently done. But <hi>Torſtenſon</hi> the <hi>Sweediſh</hi> Felt-Marſhal did generouſly, when he reſolved to put a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Garriſon of 600 men to the Sword, who were in a Sconce of the Dutchy of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> he refuſed all Parley and Treaty, and in the Storm killed them every man. Yet this action of his ſmelled too rank of revenge, for it was thought, all this blood was ſhed, becauſe a <hi>Sweediſh</hi> Admiral called <hi>Flemyng</hi> was killed with a Cannon Bullet out of that Sconce. The ſecond reaſon to kill men <hi>ad terrorem,</hi> to terrifie others, hath no ſhew of reaſon in it; for why ſhould<note place="margin" type="runSum">To the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</note> men be terrified from doing their duty? Shall a Governour yield his Fort for fear, the Beſiegers may kill him, if he yield it not? when he deſerves to be hanged by his own Prince, if he ſhould yield it for any ſuch reaſon.

                     <hi>Talio</hi> can only be uſed againſt the perſon or perſons who committed the crime, and therefore it is a trangreſſion againſt the Law of Nature, and a high injuſtice to put a Garriſon to the Sword, which either doth yield, or would yield to mercy, only becauſe the Prince or General of the other party did ſo; for none of this Garriſon now to be butchered were partakers of that crime. But this <hi>lex talionis</hi> is pretended too often for killing men after they have got Articles, and that is worſt of all, whereof I ſhall ſpeak hereafter: But other reaſons may<note place="margin">Other reaſons alledged and anſwered.</note> be given for this killing of thoſe who ſubmit to diſcretion, which the <hi>Germans</hi> call <hi>genad</hi> and <hi>ungenad,</hi> that is, mercy or no mercy, as when the Priſoners are too numerous, a powerful Enemy expected, or the Souldiers are apt to muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, if they get not the ſpoil. To the laſt I ſay, lives and the blood of men are no ſpoil nor booty; to the other two, better have refuſed (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) all Treaty and Parley: Yet this was the caſe of <hi>San Joſeph</hi> and 700 <hi>Italian</hi> Souldiers at <hi>Smerwick</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who yielded themſelves to the mercy of the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> Deputy of that Kingdom; the Officers had their lives ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were hanged, and the <hi>Italians</hi> put to the edge of the Sword<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when this was told to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that heroick Princeſs, who deteſted the killing of thoſe who yielded, ſhe was exceedingly diſpleaſed, nor would ſhe accept of any excuſes or allegations.</p>

In the Civil Wars of <hi>France,</hi> it was practiſed many times by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of both perſwaſions to put Man, Woman and Child to the Sword, or lead them out to ſome River and drown them. We read of a Proteſtant Colonel,<note place="margin">A deviliſh act.</note> who for his ſport forced all his Priſoners (except one) to leap from the top of a high Steeple; certainly this mirth of his was mixed with much miſchief. In theſe Wars, though Commanders in chief might (though not without cruelty) put Priſoners to death, to whom their inferiors had promiſed Quarter; yet I wonder, how others below them, and of a mean condition, uſurped that ſame power, and were never either puniſhed, reproved or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended for it. At the Battle of <hi>Dreux,</hi> Saint <hi>Andrew</hi> Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> had Quarter given him by a Gentleman, who mounted him on the croup of his Horſe, having no other to give him; but one <hi>Banbigni</hi> pretending the Marſhal had once wronged him at Court, ſhot him through the head, for which barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous act he was never puniſhed by the Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> who commanded the<note place="margin">Quarter baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broke.</note> Proteſtant Army, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being made Priſoner at the ſame Battle.

The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had fair Quarter given him at the Battle of <hi>Jarnac,</hi> but was thereafter inhumanly ſhot through the head by a private Gentleman, nor was ever the Murtherer called in queſtion for it. But theſe may ſeem but peccadilloes to the cruelties which are related by Hiſtorians, of ſome of which I ſhall give you a touch.</p>

Nor did his cruelty ſtop there, for by a formal Sentence he beheaded fourſcore Gentlemen of the Priſoners; all the reſt of three hundred, that were above ſeventeen years of age, he hang'd; thoſe that were under that age he condemn'd to the Galleys. An unparallel'd act of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>I have ſaid before, that quarter, unleſs promis'd by Articles, ſhould not be given to Fugitives. But here a queſtion ariſeth, If an Officer or a common<note place="margin" type="runSum">A queſtion.</note> Souldier be taken, and be not able to maintain himſelf in Priſon, and no care is had by his Superiours either to exchange, ranſome, or maintain him, if he be forc'd to take ſervice under the Enemy, and be re-taken, whether he ſhould be uſed as a Fugitive or not? Here, I ſuppoſe, a diſtinction will be<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> neceſſary. If he be the natural ſubject of the Prince or State that makes the War, he may not ſerve their Enemy on any pretence; and if he do it, he is liable to puniſhment as a Traytor; but if he ſerve him only as a mercenary, it ſeems diſputable: for the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> puniſh'd ſuch of their own as ſerv'd the Enemy, with death; but not their Auxiliaries, unleſs they had run over from them to the Enemy: but that is not the queſtion, for all Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways deſerve death; but theſe I ſpeak of are not ſuch. Yet there was a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Knight <hi>Capuz Muden,</hi> who had done <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth great ſervices, but<note place="margin">Severity.</note> was none of his Subjects; he was taken by the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and having often, and in vain ſollicited for his exchange or ranſome, he took ſervice under the <hi>French</hi> King, and after that was taken by the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> in <hi>Artois;</hi> and notwithſtanding all his defences, had his Head cut off by the Emperours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. When that Major General <hi>Kniphauſen,</hi> whom I mention'd in the laſt Chapter, was Priſoner with Count <hi>Tili,</hi> he wrote to the King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> (whoſe ſubject he was not) and deſir'd to know, (ſince he could neither main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nor ranſome himſelf) if he might take imployment under the Emperour; the King told all thoſe who were with him, That the Major General ask'd him the queſtion, Whether he might lawfully be a Knave or not? Intimating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that he might not for all his Impriſonment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> break his Military Oath. But for all that, I have known thouſands take ſervice in that manner, and never challeng'd for it when they have been re-taken: Inexorable neceſſity diſpenſing oft with tranſgreſſions of that kind.</p>
                  <p>To make thoſe Priſoners who have not taken Arms, but live in amity with<note place="margin">Injuſtice in making ſome Priſoners.</note> both parties, only becauſe they are ſuſpected to favour one party more than the other, hath little of the Law of Arms in it, and leſs of that of Conſcience. Herein the famous Count of <hi>Mansfeld</hi> is inexcuſable, for putting Guards on the Earl of <hi>Eaſt-Friezeland,</hi> when he had quarter'd his Army in his County. So was the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Felt-Marſhal <hi>Banier</hi> for ſending one of the Dukes of <hi>Saxon-Lauenburg</hi> and the Lord <hi>Arnheim</hi> Priſoners to <hi>Sueden:</hi> Neither can the late King of <hi>Sueden</hi> be well excuſed for ſeizing on the perſons of the Duke and Dutcheſs of <hi>Courland.</hi>

                  <p>The ſecuring of the Dutcheſs as well as her Husband the Duke, minds me of a queſtion, Whether Women ſhould be made Priſoners of War? it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,<note place="margin">Whether Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould be Priſoners of War, if taken.</note> in ancient and later times too, they were taken, and ranſom'd, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd, or made ſlaves; yet it would ſeem, ſince Nature hath generally exempted that Sex from making War, they cannot properly be made Priſoners of War. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> notwithſtanding make Slaves of them. And, I ſuppoſe, in our late Wars, they were not ordinarily made Priſoners, rather becauſe the cuſtome of it is worn out, than that it is abrogated by any Law.

                     </gap> Priſoners of War were made Slaves: for there be ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church extant, that forbid men to counſel Slaves to deſert their Maſters. But by tract of time all Nations, as it had been by an univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, left off to make their Priſoners Slaves, or to ſell them as ſuch, becauſe they were then better inſtructed in the Laws of Charity than to abſtain from killing miſerable Captives, only out of reſpect of gain to themſelves, or at leaſt to ſeem to be leſs cruel. But three hundred years after the Great <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s death, when <hi>Mahometaniſm</hi> had ſpread its darkneſs over the Eaſt, ſlavery was<note place="margin">Brought back by <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
                     </note> brought back to the World; and yet if you will conſider right, you will find this ſlavery and bondage of Chriſtians is not confin'd to thoſe Countreys only, where <hi>Mahomet</hi> is adored; for there are thouſands of Chriſtian Slaves to be found in the Galleys belonging to the moſt Chriſtian and Catholick Kings, the Great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the <hi>Genoways,</hi> the Pope, and the Great<note place="margin">Retain'd yet by ſome Chriſtians.</note> Maſter of <hi>Malta.</hi> And may we not ſay, That many thouſands of his Majeſties Subjects, after quarter given, were made perfect Slaves, and upon that account ſold and ſent to remote Plantations? The Great <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> did, I think, ſomething very like this, when he ſent three thouſand <hi>Croatians,</hi> commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Carabats,</hi> (who had quarter given them for life at ſeveral places in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>) by Sea to <hi>Sueden,</hi> there to work at his Iron and Copper Mines.</p>
                  <p>Among Chriſtians then, Priſoners of War being exempted from Slavery, they are to be kept till they be either exchang'd or ranſom'd, or ſet at liberty by the Victor <hi>gratis;</hi> this ſometimes falls out, but ſeldome. Sometimes they are ſet at liberty conditionally, as, If you do ſuch a thing, enjoy your liberty; if not,<note place="margin">Liberty granted to Priſoners conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> return to Priſon: and the Priſoner is oblig'd to do either the one or the other. It was the caſe of ſome <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Lords, whom <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, of <hi>England,</hi> detain'd Priſoners. He permitted them to return to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and if they could procure the Marriage of his Son, Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> with the Infant Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> then they were to have their liberty; if not, they were to return: they failing in the firſt, ſome of them honeſtly perform'd the ſecond. He that takes a Priſoner may ſearch him, and all he lays hold on is his own; but if the Priſoner hath reſerv'd ſomething hidden, that his Taker knows not of, he may make uſe of it to maintain himſelf, or to help to pay his ranſome; for he who took him hath no right to it: for Lawyers ſay, <hi>Qui neſcit, nequit poſſidere.</hi> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of Priſoners of equal quality is ordinary over all the World; if there<note place="margin">By Exchange.</note> be ſome, but no conſiderable diſparity, ſome Money ballanceth the matter. The Ranſome of a Priſoner belongs to him who took him, unleſs he be a perſon of very eminent quality, and then the Prince, the State, or their General ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth on him, giving ſome gratuity to thoſe who took him. The price of the Ranſome uſeth to be eſtimated according to his pleaſure who keeps the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;<note place="margin">By Ranſome.</note> but becauſe many times they are extravagant in their demands, an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is frequently made between the two parties who make the War, of a
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:97406:182"/> certain price to be paid by Officers, and Common Souldiers for their Ranſomes<note place="margin">A general a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement for Ranſomes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</note> according to their quality, and this ſeldom exceeds one Months pay, for any under the degree of a Colonel: and this is exceeding comfortable to Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, when they know how much themſelves or their Friends have to pay for their liberty.</p>
                  <p>But here is a queſtion, When a Priſoner agrees for his ranſome, and dyes<note place="margin" type="runSum">A Queſtion concerning ranſome.</note> before it be paid, whether the Heir be obliged to pay it? If he dye out of Priſon, there is no doubt but the Heir is bound to pay it; but if he dye in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays, his Heir is not obliged to pay it, becauſe the Priſoner had not that for which he contracted; and that was his liberty: But if the bargain be made, that the Priſoner ows the ranſome, immediately after the contract is made, the ſame <hi>Grotius</hi> ſayes, His Heir ought to pay it, becauſe the Captive<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> was not to be looked on after the finiſhing of the agreement, as a Priſoner but as a Pledge for his Ranſome. But I can tell <hi>Grotius,</hi> that the Corps of many dead Priſoners are Ranſomed. There is another queſtion, If a Priſoner Parol,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Another.</note> and ingage to get ſuch a perſon of the adverſe party ſet at liberty, and on that condition is ſet free himſelf; if the Priſoner agreed on, dye before the other can procure his liberty, whether in that caſe the Priſoner contracting be obliged to return to Priſon? <hi>Grotius</hi> ſayes no, unleſs it have been particularly ſo agreed<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwered.</note> on: yet he ſaith, he is bound to do ſomething like the equivalent, and that is to pay his own Ranſome.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould now ſpeak of thoſe Priſoners, who have Articles for life, it may be Cloths and Monys, or any thing elſe they carry about with them, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as much of their goods as they can carry on their backs: but before I enter on it, it will be fit to know what poor inferior Officers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders have to Parley, Treat, and to Grant, Sign and Seal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it will be granted, that none have power to Treat or Sign Articles<note place="margin">Of the power, inferior Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders have to grant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</note> but thoſe who command in chief on the place, whether it be in Town or Field. Princes or their Generals cannot be every where, and therefore muſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the leading of Wings or Parts of their Armies to ſubordinate Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, what ever title they may have, be it Lieutenant or Major General, Colonel or Brigadeer Generals, they Treat and Grant Conditions and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles to Enemies in the Field, or to Enemies within Towns, becauſe the emergency or neceſſity of diſpatch will not ſuffer them to adviſe with the Prince or State whom they ſerve; and therefore Articles granted by them, are to be as inviolably obſerved as if they had been Signed by the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But if either a General or any under him make a tranſaction with an Enemy againſt the known Conſtitutions and publick Laws of the Prince or State whom they ſerve, then they deſerve Puniſhment, and the Prince and State are not obliged to performance; and if ſo, they ought not, nor can they in juſtice retain what they have gained by that Capitulation, whether it be Towns, Forts, Lands, Mony or Priſoners, but are obliged if they diſapprove the Agreement, to put all in <hi>ſtatu quo prius. Grotius</hi> maintains that a General<note place="margin">What a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral may do.</note> hath not power to diſpoſe of Lands, Territories, Inheritances, and Offices and dignities (except they be military) without the Prince his expreſs War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: and there is no doubt but this aſſertion is grounded on juſt reaſon, and yet that Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> General for the Emperour, who totally routed the <hi>French</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> diſpoſed of the inheritances of moſt of thoſe who were of the <hi>French</hi> Faction, to his Captains; and not only ſo, but diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted the chief Offices of the Crown among them: and though his Maſter <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, did much diſlike of the Prince his encroaching on his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; yet that wiſe Prince ratified all that <hi>Orange</hi> had done, as knowing how dangerous it is for Soveraigns not to approve of what their Generals tranſact in their names. For if that be not done, who either dare, can, or will make any Capitulation with a General, whoſe agreement, be it never ſo authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and ſolemn may be called in queſtion and revoked by the Prince he ſerves.</p>

Nay further, If that Subordinate or Inferiour Officer grant an agreement to an Enemy, contrary to the private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions he hath from his Prince or General; yet if he have done nothing which did exceed the limits of his office and function, the Prince and General are obliged to ratifie it: Indeed they may puniſh him for his tranſgreſſion, to which the party with whom he capitulated, did contribute nothing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt not ſuffer for his Treſpaſs. As ſuppoſe a Major General hath a little Town yielded to him by accord, whereby he permits the Garriſon to march to a place of greater importance, which the Prince and his General intend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege, and have privately forbid the Major General to make any ſuch agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they may puniſh him for his preſumption, but are bound either to ſuffer the Garriſon to enjoy their Articles, or at worſt to go back to the place where they were. Let us ſumm up all that hath been ſaid in this particular, in one inſtance of <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Maharbal,</hi> and it will quadrate very fitly with the ſubject we now ſpeak of; the ſtory is this:</p>
                  <p>After the <hi>Romans</hi> werebeat at the lake <hi>Thraſimenus, Hannibal</hi> ſent <hi>Maharbal</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Maharbal</hi>'s a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with 6000 <hi>Romans,</hi>
                     </note> to purſue the Victory, ſeven or eight miles from the place of Battel, (at or near which <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſtay'd;) <hi>Maharbal</hi> finds ſix thouſand <hi>Romans</hi> in a Body, ready to accept of liberty, if granted them to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> otherwiſe to ſell their lives at a dear rate. The <hi>Carthaginian</hi> thought it not fit to hazzard the loſs of numbers of his own men on ſo ſtrong and ſo deſperate a party, and therefore agrees with them, that they ſhould deliver their Arms, and then have liberty to go home. <hi>Hannibal</hi> will not ratifie the agreement, but makes<note place="margin">Unworthily broke by <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
                     </note> all the ſix thouſand <hi>Romans</hi> Priſoners, and loads them with Irons; telling them, <hi>Maharbal</hi> had no power, without his conſent, who commanded in chief, to grant them any immunity. The worſt act ever <hi>Hannibal</hi> did. If <hi>Maharbal</hi> had no power to grant thoſe <hi>Romans</hi> their liberty, he had no power to grant them their lives; and ſo <hi>Hannibal</hi> with that ſame Juſtice might have put them all to the Sword. But firſt, <hi>Maharbal</hi> commanded in chief in that place where he capitulated; next, he did nothing that exceeded the bounds of his Office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great Commander in the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army; thirdly, he was at ſuch a diſtance from <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that he had no time to ſend for his aſſent, and do his errand, which was to purſue the flying <hi>Romans.</hi> And therefore the Hiſtorian wrongs not <hi>Hannibal,</hi> when he ſays, <hi>Punica religione ſervata fides eſt ab Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bale: Hannibal</hi> kept promiſe with a <hi>Punical</hi> Faith. Indeed, if <hi>Hannibal</hi> had been on the place he had ſaid right; and this demonſtrates what I ſaid before, that any quarter given in the field where a General is, ſignifies nothing till it be confirm'd by him; and obſerve, that Articles and Agreements made by word of mouth (as this of <hi>Maharbal</hi>'s was) bind as ſtrongly as thoſe made in writing; for Promiſes and Parolls of Princes and Captains ſhould be ſacredly kept.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grotius</hi> acknowledgeth, that <hi>Maharbal</hi>'s agreement ſhould not have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed by <hi>Hannibal;</hi> and yet in that ſame Chapter affirms, That <hi>Maſaniſſa,</hi> King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> a Friend and Ally of the <hi>Romans</hi> had not power to grant the fair <hi>Sophonisbe</hi> her life. I am not at all of <hi>Grotius</hi> his judgement: For firſt,<note place="margin">So was that of <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> to <hi>Sophonisbe,</hi> by <hi>Scipio.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> acted by <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Commiſſion; ſecondly, he was far from <hi>Scipio;</hi> third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he commanded in chief where he then was; fourthly, <hi>Sophonisbe</hi> was not by any former publick Law exempted from pardon; fifthly, if <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> had private inſtructions to take her life, <hi>Scipio</hi> might have puniſh'd him, but <hi>Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisbe</hi> ſhould not have ſuffer'd for his tranſgreſſion, but ſhould either have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd her life, or been ſent back with all her people, to the Caſtle where ſhe was taken. And aſſuredly, <hi>Maſaniſſa</hi> had power to grant her life, and marry her too, as he did; but he preferr'd the <hi>Roman</hi> friendſhip to the love of his Beautiful Wife, and ſo ſent her a Cup of Poyſon, as the laſt token of his affection.</p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:97406:183"/>
                  <p>This that I have ſaid, may be accommodated and applied to <hi>James</hi> Duke of<note place="margin">Duke <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s death, Murther.</note> 
                     <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s caſe, who had Articles granted to him, and all that were with him for life; which, becauſe <hi>Lambert</hi> avouched he had given, the pretended Parliament of <hi>England</hi> did not deny it, but ſaid, with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that <hi>Lambert</hi> being ſubalterne had not power to give ſuch conditions; but he had power, for he exceeded not the limits of his Office, and function of a Major General; he commanded in chief on the place where he capitulated; and we never heard that <hi>Cromwel</hi> did charge him with the tranſgreſſion of any of his private inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions at that time; and <hi>Cromwel</hi> was ſo far from <hi>Lambert</hi> then, that he could not poſſibly ſend to him for his aſſent; and if <hi>Lambert</hi>'s ſuperiours thought it not fit to approve of what he had done, then in Juſtice (which was a great Stranger in their Courts) they ſhould have ſet the Duke, and all that were with him at liberty, and then have taken their hazzard of all the miſchief could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal them: All which concludes that the death of that unfortunate Lord was plain Murther.</p>
                  <p>Of this ſtamp was that agreement made by thoſe who took Count <hi>Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Count <hi>de Montgomery</hi>'s little better.</note> who had kill'd <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, of <hi>France,</hi> at Tilting, ſore againſt his will: He had done very ſignal ſervices to the Proteſtants, in the time of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars, and at length was beſieged in the Caſtle of <hi>Domfron,</hi> which he maintain'd gallantly, reſolving to dye with his Sword in his hand; but being at length deſerted by moſt of thoſe that were with him, he accepted of conditions, which were, That his Life ſhould be ſafe, and he ſhould only be Priſoner a few days, and then have his liberty. But the Queen Mother, <hi>Catherine de Medici,</hi> pretending that thoſe Lords who had beſieg'd the Caſtle, had no power to grant any ſuch conditions, caus'd him to be brought to <hi>Paris,</hi> where his Head was publickly cut off in the <hi>Greve,</hi> not without a previous torture. At that ſame time, his Son <hi>Lorges</hi> yielded <hi>Carentan</hi> upon Articles, but had been likewiſe ſent to <hi>Paris,</hi> there to partake of his Fathers fate, if he had not been dextrouſly ſhifted out of the way, and ſuffer'd to eſcape, by a near Kinſman of his own.</p>
                  <p>Many Parleys and Treaties are without any Ceſſation of Arms. That at <hi>Munſter,</hi> which produc'd the Peace in the year 1648. laſted ſix years, and yet the War in <hi>Germany</hi> was as hot and fierce as ever. And ſo it was in <hi>England</hi> in the<note place="margin">Ceſſations of Arms, and Parleys.</note> time of the Treaty of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xbridge.</hi> But if there be a ceſſation of Arms, which you may call a Truce, during the time of it, acts of hoſtility ceaſe, yet Armies may retire, Souldiers may be levied, Fortifications may be helped, unleſs by Articles all or any of theſe be forbid. If this Truce, or Ceſſation be broke by one party, the other may lawfully run to Arms, without any new denunciation of the War; or he may not do it, as he pleaſeth, or thinks convenient for the preſent poſture of his affairs. Commonly at Sieges, in time of Parley and Ceſſation, all works above or under ground are forbidden.</p>
                  <p>But when Beſieged Towns, Caſtles and Camps are neceſſitated to<note place="margin">Towns and Forts ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd in time of Treaty.</note> come to a Parley, though there be a ceſſation of Arms, let neither the Beſieger nor the Beſieged truſt to it, but ſtand on their guard, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times the Beſieged, contrary to agreement, Sally, to deſtroy the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, to ſhift away their Horſe-men, or ſome of them for Intelligence; and oftner do the Beſiegers take the advantage of a Parley, and without his order or knowledge who commands in chief, fall on the Beſieged place, whoſe Garriſon then over-wearied with former fatigue, is ſecure, and ſo ſoon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter'd: For the deſire of booty, whereof the Treaty robs the Souldiers, ſtirs them up to take their advantage of thoſe, who thinking themſelves ſafe by a Ceſſation, make little or no reſiſtance. And though the Beſieger who commands in chief, may pretend it was done without his knowledge, yet he keeps what he hath got as his lawful gain, without any thought of reſtitution. Thus was <hi>Therouen,</hi> and <hi>Monmorancy,</hi> Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> in it, taken by the<note place="margin">Inſtances.</note> 
                     <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> in time of Parley and Ceſſation. Thus <hi>Coqueville</hi> at <hi>Sainct Valery</hi> was ſurpriz'd in the time of Treaty, by the Marſhal <hi>de Coſſe</hi> his Forces. Thus the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Fontenay</hi> kept by the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants in the year 1574. in the time of Treaty was ſtorm'd by the Duke of <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> at the breaches of the Wall, and though it was defended at that time, yet it was forc'd to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, for fear of a ſecond Aſſault, on mean conditions. And thus was <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> ſtorm'd in the year 1579. by the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Army, where
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:97406:183"/> moſt of the Souldiers and Inhabitants, in time of Parley, were put to the Sword, after they had defended themſelves bravely for the ſpace of four months. Nor can I fancy there can be better ways found out to prevent ſuch<note place="margin">

                  <p>When Articles are ſign'd, I ſuppoſe, there is not any man of what perſwaſion ſoever, but will ſay they ſhould be religiouſly obſerv'd, and inviolably kept, neither is it in the power of any, either Prince or State, to break them without perfidy and violation of Faith, the very Cut-throats of humane ſociety.

This ſo enraged the Duke, that he reſolv'd to put that Monſter of a Governour, and the four hundred Souldiers, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Skeletons, that came out with him, to the edge of the Sword; and here you may be ſure unjuſt Revenge put on the mask of <hi>Lex Talionis.</hi> This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowable action of the Governour of <hi>Briſac</hi> ſhould be a Caveat to all Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours not to bring many Priſoners into beſieged places, for thoſe reaſons I mention'd in my Diſcourſe of Sieges. But if the Duke had done as he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he had been as guilty of perfidy, as <hi>Reinach</hi> was of inhumanity. And therefore the Great Commanders of his Army repreſented to him the ugly face of fedifragy in its lively colours, which did fully divert him from an action unworthy of ſo brave and ſo renown'd a Prince.</p>

In the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars of <hi>France,</hi> I find, that a Souldier, after he had got quarter, was tortur'd, by pouring in Water at his mouth, till his belly grew as great as an Ox head, and yet dyed without revealing any thing he knew. A Captain<note place="margin">Inhumanity.</note> who had eſcap'd out of <hi>Sancerre,</hi> and was looking for aſſiſtance to that hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarved Town, was taken, and tormented with the blows of Cudgels on the Belly, till he told all he knew, or all they would have him to tell, and then they hang'd him for his pains.</p>
                  <p>The fear of bad quarter, of hard and cruel uſage, of the breach of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties<note place="margin">Fear of bad quarter.</note> and Articles, hath made many reſolve to take no quarter at all, and to chuſe to dye fighting: Whether theſe be acceſſory to their own death, whether this be not ſelf deſertion, or whether it be diffidence of the Almighties power, ſhall not be the ſubject of this Diſcourſe. But I ſhall ſay that Self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is a Law imprinted in the hearts of all men by Nature, and when with Honour and Reputation, a Souldier, either of high or low degree, may have fair quarter, he both may, and ſhould accept of it, both to preſerve himſelf for his maſters ſervice, and his own future fortune, and that without the leaſt aſperſion of Cowardiſe. That which is commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the Emperours Crabats, and the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s <hi>Finlanders,</hi> that none of them would either give or take quarter, is a meer ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; for I have known them both give and take it very contentedly. <hi>Philopaemon</hi> may ſtand as a Beacon to all Souldiers, whether they be Pagans,<note place="margin">Philopaemon.</note> Infidels, or Chriſtians, not to preſume, or yet be confident never to be Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners: Of a mean Gentleman, he came by his valour and conduct to be Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and General of the <hi>Achaans</hi> ſeven or eight times: Dining one day with ſome of his Friends, he heard them much commend one of his acquaintance for an excellent good Souldier: <hi>How can he</hi> (ſaid <hi>Philopaemon) be a good Souldier, who deliver'd once himſelf Priſoner.</hi> But this great Captain (who had now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd with much Honour to the age of ſeventy years) did not foreſee his fate, which the very next day (while he made good the Retreat of ſome <hi>Ach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe Law is a Dumb Judge, and a Judge is a Speaking Law. In vain it is to make Laws, unleſs Judges look to their execution, for that is the life of the Law. I have ſpoke in another place of the Military Puniſhments and Rewards of the Ancients, I have likewiſe ſpoke of our Modern Military Laws; where obſerve, that moſt of them threaten Puniſhment, few or none promiſe Reward; the firſt is due to Tranſgreſſors, the ſecond is <hi>ex beneplacito,</hi> becauſe all men are bound to do their duty; yet Princes and States have reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Vertue of late times, as well as the Ancients did. I ſhall ſpeak of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and then of Rewards.</p>
                  <p>Though Princes and States have their ſeveral Laws of War, yet all agree<note place="margin">Puniſhment of Capital crimes, Treaſon,</note> that Treaſon againſt the Prince, in betraying either his Forts, Forces, or Munitions, ſhould be puniſh'd with an ignominious Death, but the crime ſhould be throughly examin'd by the Judge Marſhal, and Court of War, whereof I have formerly ſpoke. Mutiny againſt Command, or Superiour<note place="margin">Mutiny,</note> Officers is puniſhable by Death: If it cannot be compeſc'd without force, either all, or moſt of the Army are to be call'd together, to cut the Mutineers in pieces. But if a Mutiny be quieted without blood (in doing whereof both Courage and Prudence are requiſite) then ordinarily the ring-leaders are to dye, and the reſt are eitheir all pardon'd, or all to run the <hi>Gatloupe,</hi> or the tenth man of them is to ſuffer death; which cuſtome is borrow'd from the Ancient <hi>Romans.</hi> If Officers run away from the Mutineers, and leave them mutinying, the Law of War orders them to dye, unleſs they can make it appear, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had kill'd ſome of the Mutineers, or had been wounded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by them: But it is not to be denied, that too many of them are more ready to give a riſe and beginning to a Mutiny, than to put an end to it. The Death of a Mutineer ſhould be ignominious, and therefore it ſhould be hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or breaking on a Wheel. All crimes that are Capital by the Civil Law,<note place="margin">Many more.</note> are ſo alſo by Martial Law, as Wilful Murther, Robbery, Theft, Inceſt, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domy, and others, needleſs to be rehears'd. But Martial Law makes many crimes Capital, which the Civil and Municipal Law doth not; Such are, to deſert the Colours, to Sleep on Sentinel, to be drunk on a Watch, to draw a Sword or ſtrike at a Superiour; many times theſe are pardon'd, and very oft they are puniſh'd with Death, when a General thinks Juſtice more convenient than Mercy. To be abſent from a Watch, by ſome Military Laws is Capital, but ſeldome put in execution: Yet I find in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, of <hi>France,</hi> that one <hi>Granvill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To run away in time of ſervice, either in the Field, or from the Aſſaults of Towns, Forts and Out-works, brings Death
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:97406:185"/> upon the guilty; or that which to generous Spirits is worſe than death, that is, to have their Swords broke over their Heads by the hand of the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſo turn'd out of the Army; and this I have known more frequently practis'd, than death inflicted; but the Inſtances I could give are too freſh, and therefore I ſhall tell you only of one about a hundred years ago. At the Siege of <hi>Dinan, Gaſpar Coligni,</hi> that famous Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> commanded ſome Enſign-bearers to run with their Colours to the Aſſault of the breach; they did not go, pretending the place was too dangerous for the Kings Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, for they might chance to be taken by the Enemy; for which the Admiral caus'd all their Swords to be broke over their Heads by a Hang-man, in view<note place="margin">An ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> of his whole Army. It will be about two or three and thirty years ſince <hi>Leopold</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and his Lieutenant General <hi>Piccolomini,</hi> cauſed a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Horſe to be cut in pieces, and all the Officers to be hanged in the place, where-ever they could be apprehended, without any Proceſs or Sentence of a Court of War, becauſe it was well known, that the whole Regiment had run<note place="margin">An exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> away in a full body, without fighting, at the ſecond Battel of <hi>Leipſick,</hi> where the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Felt-marſhal <hi>Torſtenſon</hi> gain'd the Victory over the <hi>Imperialiſts.</hi> I have ſpoke in the laſt Chapter of the puniſhment due to thoſe Governours who give over Forts ſooner than they need, and gave you ſome inſtances; but now I ſhall tell you, that by ſome Articles of War, the whole Garriſon is lyable to puniſhment, which is, to be Pioneers to the reſt of the Army. I dare ſay<note place="margin">A ſevere Law.</note> nothing againſt the Juſtice of this Law, but, I think, if the Garriſon diſobey the Governour, and do not march out at his command, (he pretending the Prince or Generals order for what he does) all of it may undergo the cenſure and puniſhment of Mutiny: But many Laws are made <hi>ad terrorem,</hi> which do but little good.</p>
                  <p>I think, the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Puniſhments not imitable by thoſe who profeſs the name<note place="margin">Inhumane puniſhments.</note> of Chriſt; ſuch as are, roaſting at ſlow fires, flaying quick, and gaunching; the manner of this laſt is, to throw the condemned perſon from the top of a Tower or a high Wall, the place where he is to fall, being all beſet with Iron pricks; and the wretch is happy if his Head, Breaſt, or Belly fall on one of them, for thereby he may be ſoon diſpatched; but if a Leg, Arm or Thigh catch hold, he muſt hang till extremity of pain, hunger, thirſt, and the fowls of the air, put an end to his miſerable life. The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> for a Military Puniſhment can whip to death, and that is cruel enough. They and other Chriſtians can impale condemned perſons on wooden Stakes and Spits, which in ſome extraordinary caſes is alſo practiſed in <hi>Germany;</hi> and I have heard, that Hang-men can ſo artificially do it, that the woful Delinquent will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times live three days in unſpeakable torture. When <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Great, ſaw a Valley in <hi>Valachia</hi> beſet with theſe Stakes and Wheels, on which ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Men and Women lay executed, it is ſaid that he much commended the Vayvod or Prince of that Countrey for a good Juſtitiary; ſo near did the one of their tempers, both barbarous and cruel, reſemble the other.</p>
                  <p>The faireſt and juſteſt way of Puniſhment is by Courts of War, if the caſe do not require a preſent animadverſion: And that Court is to judge, and give Sentence according to the Military Laws of the Prince or State, in whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice the Army is. When the Sentence is pronounced, the General may either<note place="margin">Generals may pardon.</note> pardon the offender, or delay the execution, or alter the manner of his death. The moſt honourable death for a Delinquent Souldier is accounted Behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the next to that is Shooting, (which commonly is called Harquebuſiering) if he be a Horſe-man, with Piſtols; if a Foot Souldier, with Muskets. But the Puniſhments of ſeveral Crimes are left by Martial Law, to the arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Court of War; and ſome of theſe, aggravated by circumſtances, are made Capital, though in themſelves they be not ſuch; of which, demurring to give preſent obedience, if an Enemy be conceiv'd to be near, is one; and this falls frequently out.</p>
                  <p>Military Puniſhments, which reach not to Death, are the Strappado, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Ordinary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</note> up by the Thumbs, ſo that only the Delinquents Toes can touch the ground; laying Muskets on their Shoulders, more or fewer, for a longer or ſhorter time, according to the quality of the fault; to be kept in Priſon ſo many days or weeks with Irons on them; and ſometimes to be fed only with
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:97406:185"/> Bread and Water in Priſon. Obſerve here, that without a Sentence of a Court<note place="margin">A neceſſary obſervation.</note> of War, no Superiour Commander, be who he will, can keep an Inferiour Officer or Common Souldier longer in Priſon than the impriſoned party calls for a hearing. There is alſo riding the Wooden Horſe, on which ſometimes the Offender hath his hands tyed behind his back, and ſometimes Muskets, or other weights tyed to his feet: As likewiſe to be turned out of the Army by the Hang-man, to have their Ears cut off by the Hang-man, to be whipp'd by the Hang-man, to have their Swords broke by the Hang-man. I have known ſome who thought, that Souldiers who are whipp'd at <hi>Gatloupe,</hi> ſhould be turned out of the Army; which is a groſs miſtake, for they are appointed to be whipped by their Comerades, that they may be kept in the Army, for after an Officer or Souldier is put in a Hang-mans hand, he ſhould ſerve no longer in any Army. <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> firſt began it, in imitation<note place="margin">The original and derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Gatloup.</hi>
                     </note> belike of the cuſtome the <hi>Roman</hi> Centurions had to whip their Souldiers. It is a <hi>German</hi> word, <hi>Gaſlauf,</hi> and comes from <hi>Gas,</hi> or <hi>Gat,</hi> which ſignifieth a Street; and <hi>Lauffen,</hi> or <hi>Louppen,</hi> which is, to run; becauſe he who is to be whipp'd, is to run through a Street, between two rows of Souldiers. The Provoſt Marſhal is to furniſh Rods, and to give the Delinquent the firſt laſh; but if there be neither Provoſt nor Lieutenant, nor Servant of his (who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Stokknecht</hi>) then the Drummers give the Rods.</p>
                  <p>But there are ſeveral caſes which require preſent Puniſhments to be inflicted<note place="margin">In what caſes Officers may ſtrike, wound, or kill.</note> by Officers and Commanders, without committing the Delinquents to Priſon, or calling them before a Court of War; as in point of obſtinacy, either in not doing the thing that is commanded, or not doing it in that manner that the Officer would have it done; the giving undutiful language in preſence of a Superiour; ſpeaking after ſilence is commanded; ſtanding ſtill after one is commanded to march or go: In any of theſe, and many other caſes, a Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant may make uſe of his Halbert, and a Commiſſionated Officer of his Battoon, if the party offending be either an Inferiour Officer, or a Common Souldier. Nay, there be ſome caſes wherein Officers may cut, wound, yea, kill, as in a Mutiny; whereof I have ſpoke already: In caſe Souldiers be Plundering, and will not forbear, when commanded; in caſe two be brawling and fighting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and will not leave off: But killing ſhould be uſed by no Officer, but where the ſervice of the Prince, or the Vindication of Juſt Authority make it neceſſary. And therefore to kill Souldiers when they ſtraggle on a march, unleſs they refuſe to obey, and return to their Companies, I think is a crime in any Commander or Officer, except in a Marſhal or Rumour-maſter. And here I muſt acquaint my Reader with ſome nice diſtinctions that ſome make of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours beating their Inferiours.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, that none under a Colonel may kill, nay, nor thruſt with the point,<note place="margin">Some nice Queſtions. Firſt.</note> or ſtrike with the edge of a Sword, only they may ſtrike with the broad ſide of it; but in ſome of theſe caſes, which I have mention'd, eſpecially Mutiny, both Commiſſion'd and Uncommiſſion'd Officers may ſtrike with the edge, thruſt with the point, yea, kill with their Swords; and if they do it not, they may be quoſtion'd upon their lives. Secondly, ſay ſome, A Sergeant ſhould<note place="margin">Second.</note> beat with nothing but his Halbert; and ſo ſay I too, if he have it by him (which he is not always bound to have;) but if not, he both may and ought to do it with his Sword, when emergencies require it. Thirdly, they will tell you, a Corporal<note place="margin">Third.</note> muſt only beat with a Musket-reſt, if he ſerve to foot, (for Corporals of Horſe, they grant, may beat with their Swords,) but Musket-reſts are now out of faſhion, and when they were uſed, if a Corporal broke one of them in beating a Souldier, who ſhould pay for it, the Corporal or the Souldier, is a hard queſtion: He may therefore beat with his Sword, for none under an Enſign-bearer ſhould be permitted to carry a Battoon; an abuſe too much ſuffer'd. But fourthly, many Intelligent Commanders have averr'd, that none<note place="margin">Fourth.</note> but a Major may ſtrike with a Battoon, as alſo that he may beat with it any Officer under a Captain, that is, both Lieutenants and Enſigns, which they ſay is no affront to them, provided the Major immediately throw away his Battoon, and draw his Sword. Truly, there is no new cuſtome but appears ſtrange and bizarre at firſt, till it become common, and then it doth not ſeem ſtrange at all. I find by my Lord <hi>Carbouſen</hi>'s teſtimony that this was the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:97406:186"/> Military cuſtome in <hi>France,</hi> in the latter end of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, not much more than threeſcore years ago. But that whereat I wonder is, that a Battoon at that time, and yet, was not more odious to any people under the Sun than to the <hi>French</hi> Nation. But mark the reaſon that is given for this cuſtome, Becauſe a Major (ſays <hi>Louis de Montgomery</hi>) carried always a Staff three foot and a half, or four foot long, to meaſure the length of the Souldiers huts, and with that he might ſtrike, and with no other. A ſtrange reaſon, I know no precedent for this cuſtome, except that perhaps Drapers and Taylors may beat their Journey-men and Apprentices with thoſe Ells or Yards, wherewith they meaſure their Cloath. But now thoſe whom the <hi>French</hi> call Marſhals of Quarters, and we Quarter-maſters, meaſure out to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers their proportion of ground for their huts, and ought to have a meaſure for it, may they therefore beat with it? I trow not. And why a Major ſhould be permitted to ſtrike with a Battoon more than a Lieutenant-Colonel, or a Colonel; or in <hi>France,</hi> more than a Captain (who often commands the Major) is more than I can divine. The Cuſtome is a great deal better to ſtrike at Lieutenants and Enſigns, with Swords, if neceſſity force their Superiours, (as ſometimes it may) to ſtrike at them at all. Fifthly, I have heard ſome very<note place="margin">Fifth.</note> Philoſophically diſcourſe, and argue, That if a Superiour Commander draws his Sword againſt his Inferiour, the Inferiour is obliged to retire ſeven ſteps back; but if the Superiour purſue beyond that limit, the Inferiour may draw in his Defence. But this Argument is near in kin to ſome of thoſe that are uſed for reſiſtance of the Lawful and Civil Authority, and is an Uſher of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: It caſts all Order, Diſcipline and Command in a Chaos of Confuſion: At beſt, it is but the contemplation of ſome Speculative brain; for who can tell whether the Inferiour hath gone back thoſe ſeven ſteps, or not? Who reckon'd them? Witneſſes will not agree in the meaſure. It is true, it is neither fit nor handſome, that the Superiour ſhould purſue his Inferiour, if he pay him that reſpect as to retire from him; but if that Superiour will purſue, it is permitted (and if I miſtake not, commanded,) that the Inferiour fly, but not at all reſiſt. But this is too tickliſh a theme for Military Diſcourſes. Though there may be other puniſhments, yet, I ſuppoſe, I have ſpoke of moſt. And now I ſhall deſire all of my profeſſion; of what quality ſoever they be, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate their puniſhments to the crime; and to take good heed (as they will anſwer it one day to the great Judge) they do not revenge their private quarrels and grudges under the cloak of publick Juſtice. It is true, Military perſons may ſay, That this warning of mine concerns them no more than it doth thoſe who officiate both in Church and State, and neither indeed doth it.</p>
                  <p>I come now to our Military Rewards, which I may rank in three Claſſes,<note place="margin">Several kinds of Rewards.</note> thoſe are, Advancement in Military charges, Titles of Honour, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences or gratuities of Lands, or Money. The firſt and the third are, in my opinion, common to both Commanders and common Souldiers; for a Musketeer advanc'd to a Corporals place, and getting ten or twenty Shillings of Benevolence, hath his preferment and his gratuity, as well as that Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who is advanc'd to be a Lieutenant General, and gets a Donative of 20000 <hi>l.</hi> Sterling. But Titles of Honour are only given to deſerving Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd Officers, and to none below them. Among thoſe Titles I reckon that to be one, to be made a Gentleman, and this is in oppoſition of what is commonly ſaid, That all Souldiers are Gentlemen. I knew when the late Emperour, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Third, made Major General <hi>Sperreuter</hi> (who had done great ſervices in the Wars) a Gentleman by Patent, becauſe he was none by birth, and gave him a Coat of Arms. Moſt of all Titles of Honour, as Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Barons, and Knights, have been given for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in the Wars; notwithſtanding which, Princes neither can, nor will be reſtricted to confer Honours on others of their Subjects, who both have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd or may deſerve Honour as well as Sword-men: But herein I will not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to play the Herauld. The time was never, is not, nor can in reaſon be<note place="margin">Princes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reward all who have ſerved them.</note> ever expected to be, that Kings can gratifie all who have ſerv'd them Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The late Emperour, in our own time, conferr'd both Riches and Honour on many; yet where one who had ſerv'd him, was rewarded, two hundred were
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:97406:186"/> not. Queen <hi>Chriſtina</hi> of <hi>Sweden,</hi> was ſo profuſe in beſtowing both Honours and Lands on thoſe who had done her ſervice in the <hi>German</hi> War, that ſhe was thought to have made a proſtitution of the firſt, and to have diſpoſed of the ſecond, even to the ſenſible diminution of the Revenues of the Crown; and yet not one Officer of a hundred that had ſerv'd her, taſted of her libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. His Majeſty now reigning, hath honour'd and enrich'd many, but it is not poſſible for him to reward all; yet thoſe who have not got, ſhould not envy thoſe on whom he hath conferr'd his Princely Favours and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>The ancient cuſtome of praiſing and commending thoſe who have done any particular kind of Military ſervice, continues yet; for every General doth ſomething like it, but they have not that power over the Treaſury, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Conſuls had in the Fields. Our late Politicians can tell us, That their Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were ſo wiſe, as not to entruſt both the Sword and the Purſe to one perſon, and yet Souldiers were never better paid, nor the Prince his ſervice better done, than when he who commanded the Arms, commanded the Purſe likewiſe. But when a General cannot reward of himſelf, he ſhould not fail to acquaint his Maſter<note place="margin">Generals ſhould make Gentlemens ſervices known.</note> with the names of the perſons who have done him ſervices, with a ſpecification what thoſe were. Marſhal <hi>Monluc</hi> had done great things to <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, when he was but Colonel, under the Count of <hi>Briſac,</hi> Marſhal of <hi>France:</hi> The Noble Earl did repreſent thoſe ſervices ſo handſomely to the <hi>French</hi> King, that <hi>Monluc</hi> was made Gentleman of the Bed-chamber, and Governour of <hi>Sainct Abbe</hi> in <hi>Savoy.</hi> Upon this ſubject, he hath theſe expreſſions in the Second Book of the firſt Tome of his Commentaries: <q rend="inline">It is an unſpeakable grief to a<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Monluc</hi> his ſenſe of it.</note> Gentleman, who hath liberally expos'd his life in ſeveral actions, when both himſelf and his ſervices are conceal'd from the Prince, upon whom all the Lives, Honours, and Fortunes of his Servants do depend; there is no theft, ſays he, nor robbery comparable to that which is made of a mans Honour: And yet many Generals make no Conſcience to commit that theft, and that Robbery.</q> Thus far <hi>Monluc.</hi> And ſince he dyed, Experience hath hath confirm'd the truth of his Obſervation, Generals loving too well to take both the praiſe and benefit of all that is done well to themſelves, and with a great deal of dexterity, they lay the miſcarriage of all their own actions at other mens doors. The <hi>Suediſh</hi> Felt-Marſhals, <hi>Banier</hi> and <hi>Torſtenſon,</hi> in our own time, were none of thoſe Generals, for they rewarded Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers themſelves, as well as they could; and when they could not help them, they generouſly recommended them to the Adminiſtrators of <hi>Sweden,</hi> in the Queens minority, with a grateful remembrance of their ſervices.</p>
                  <p>Knighthood, in former times, was a peculiar and honourable reward of<note place="margin">Knighthood.</note> Military men, and that which is conferr'd in the Field, in time of action, is aſſuredly the moſt honourable. But Soveraign Princes have thought it fit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when they were infeſted with War, or other grievous calamities, or after ſome glorious Victory, to unite and tye ſome of their Great Captains and Chieftains in a fraternity, and to confer on them, with ſplendid and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Ceremonies, a peculiar Order of Knighthood, thereby to enflame both them and others, to Vertuous and Valorous actions: The oldeſt, and moſt<note place="margin">Several or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of it.</note> Honourable, is that of the Garter, inſtituted by <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> under the Patrociny of Saint <hi>George;</hi> as that of the Thiſtle of <hi>Scotland</hi> was under Saint <hi>Andrew. John</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> inſtituted the order of the Star, under the protection of Saint <hi>Owen,</hi> ſay the <hi>French;</hi> as one of his Succeſſors, <hi>Louis</hi> the Eleventh, inſtituted that of Saint <hi>Michael.</hi> In the minority of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, of <hi>England,</hi> when the War was hot between that Kingdom and <hi>France, Philip le Bou,</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> inſtituted the Noble Order of the Golden Fleece, under the protection of Saint <hi>Andrew.</hi> The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> makes Knights of the Elephant, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> thoſe of the Annunciation. <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> Queen of <hi>Sueden,</hi> inſtituted a new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Knighthood, which ſhe would have called the Order of the <hi>Amaranth;</hi> which, they ſay, never withers, and accordingly ſhe appointed the Device to be <hi>ſemper idem.</hi> The Knights of the <hi>Teutonick,</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> Order, thoſe of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> called afterwards Hoſpitallers, Knights of the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and now of <hi>Malta;</hi> as alſo thoſe of the Sepulchre, or Knights Templars, were, and

But there were likewiſe Religious Orders, for they vowed Chaſtity, Poverty, and Obedience: And from Religion have come moſt of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Orders of Knighthood. <hi>Sanctius,</hi> the third of that name, King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> for the more vigorous proſecution of the War againſt the Infidels, inſtituted the Order of <hi>Calatrava,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Toledo:</hi> The Maſter of which Order is a perſon of great Riches and Power. His Son <hi>Alphonſe</hi> the Ninth (in the time of his dangerons War with the <hi>Moors</hi>) inſtituted the Order of Saint <hi>James,</hi> which hath ſince come to that heighth of power, that the Maſter of it is one of the greateſt Subjects of <hi>Spain:</hi> But <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the firſt Catholick King, made himſelf and his Succeſſors (with the help of the Pope) Maſters of theſe Orders. One of the Kings of <hi>Portugal,</hi> when he had Wars with both the <hi>Saracens</hi> of <hi>Africk</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> inſtituted the Order of the Knights of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> About the year 1570. the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> cauſed 12<note place="margin">Jane d'Albret.</note> great Medals of Gold to be coined, which ſhe diſtributed among 12 of the moſt eminent Chieftains of the Reformed Religion, as tokens of their fraternity, to incite them to Conſtancy, Valour, and Perſeverance, in the Cauſe againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks. Upon one ſide of the Medal were theſe words: <hi>Aſſured Peace, Entire Victory, or Honeſt Death.</hi> On the Reverſe was the Queens own name, with that of her Son, the Prince of <hi>Bearne,</hi> who was afterwards. <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, the Great, King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navarre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>War drains the Treaſures of Princes and States ſo dry, that for moſt part they are not able to pay the Wages and Arrears of thoſe who ſerve them, much leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them. The <hi>Roman</hi> Oak, Olive, and Laurel Crowns, are out of faſhion long ago, nor would they ſignifie any thing, but rather be ridiculous, unleſs they were given with all the Wages due to the party, who is to be honour'd with one of thoſe Crowns, as the <hi>Romans</hi> were accuſtomed to do. I have obſerv'd in another place, how in many parts of Chriſtendome, Officers, above the quality of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Captains, many times are reduced to beggary; to obviate which, ſince Princes and States cannot forbear War, or will not live in Peace, it would be a great work of Charity in them, and would much redound to their Honour<note place="margin">Works of Charity.</note> and Fame, to build ſome Hoſpitals, and endue them with ſome ſmall Revenue, in which thoſe Commanders who are lame, old, and poor, might get a morſel of Bread; which would be an exceeding great relief to thoſe diſtreſſed Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and much encourage younger people to engage in a freſh War; for alaſs, though written Teſtimonies, ſign'd and ſeal'd by the Prince or his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, may be of good uſe to young and luſty Gallants, who have their Health, and ſome Money in their Purſes, to look for new Fortunes; yet Paſſes (though never ſo favourable) to poor old men, are, upon the matter, nothing elſe<note place="margin">Paſſes.</note> but fair Commiſſions to beg.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XXVIII.</hi> The Compariſon made by <hi>Juſtus Lipſius</hi> of the Ancient and Modern Militia, examined.</head>
                  <p>IT is one of the Curſes that follow'd <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, and I think was inherent in<note place="margin">Diſcontent follows hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature.</note> him before his fall, that as he was not, ſo none of his Poſterity can be content with his preſent condition. The longing deſire we have to enjoy that we want, robs us of the content we may have of what we poſſeſs. Hence it is, that old men cry up thoſe cuſtomes that were uſed when they were Boys, vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the preſent, and magnifying the by-paſt times. Neither is this <hi>faſtidium,</hi> or loathing of preſent things, the concomitant of age only, for young men, who are in their ſtrength, are tainted with it. Some are diſpleaſed with the Government of the State, others hugely diſſatisfied with that of the Church, becauſe none of them are caſt in thoſe moulds, which they fancy to be better than the preſent ones; and though perhaps they cannot pretend to have ſeen better in their own times, yet they have heard or read of thoſe which they conceive were ſo abſolutely good, that nothing can be added to their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Others like only of thoſe Governments which have their birth, riſe, growth, and perfection in their own giddy brains.</p>
                  <p>But to come nearer our purpoſe, few Souldiers are ſatisfied with their own Countrey Militia; for if they have been abroad in the World, at their return home, they cry up the Arms, the Art, and the Diſcipline of Foreigners; nor can they find any thing at home can pleaſe them. And though their occaſions have never invited them to take a view of ſtrange places, yet their Books af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them matter enough, to prefer thoſe Arms, thoſe Exerciſes, thoſe Guards, thoſe Figures of Battels, that Diſcipline of War they never ſaw, to all thoſe they may daily ſee. Of this diſeaſe of Diſcontent, I think, <hi>Juſtus Lipſius</hi> hath been<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Juſtus Lipſius</hi> an admirer of the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia.</note> irrecoverably ſick, and though he did not compile a Military Syſteme of his own, as <hi>Machiavelli</hi> did; yet I may compare theſe two in this, that both of them were Speculative Souldiers. <hi>Lipſius</hi> is ſo far diſguſted with the Milice of his own time, (which truly, being about eighty or ninety years ago, was an excellent one) which he might have ſeen and obſerv'd, better than his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings ſhows he did; and is ſo much in love with the old <hi>Roman</hi> Militia, (which he never ſaw but by contemplation) that in the compariſon he makes of the two, in the laſt Chapter of his Commentary on <hi>Polybius,</hi> he is not aſham'd to prefer the Ancient Art of War to the Modern one, in all its dimenſions.</p>
                  <p>As I conceive, he was ſo Rational as to think no man would deny the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern<note place="margin">He compares it with the Modern Art of War,</note> Milice to want its imperfections; ſo, I ſuppoſe, none will be ſo void of Reaſon, as to grant to him, that the <hi>Roman</hi> one was abſolutely perfect. He hath read it ſure in the beſt of Authors, That nothing below the Sun is perfect. And I would have it obſerved, that though the Title of the Compariſon be, Of the Ancient and Modern Militia, yet all along in the Compariſon it ſelf he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons only the <hi>Roman,</hi> as if that had been the only Ancient one, whereas he knew the <hi>Grecian</hi> was more Ancient than it, the <hi>Judaick</hi> older than the <hi>Grecian,</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> older than all the three. My purpoſe then being neither to derogate from the excellent worth of the <hi>Roman,</hi> nor to vilipend the Modern Art of War, I hope, without any offence to the aſhes of the Learned <hi>Lipſius</hi> I may take a view of his Compariſon, wherein he ſpeaks of all the five eſſential<note place="margin">In five points.</note> points of War, and in them all gives the preheminence to the <hi>Roman;</hi> let us hear his Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>The firſt point is Election or Levy, of which he avers very magiſterially<note place="margin">Firſt, in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Levy.</note> that the <hi>Roman</hi> was the beſt, and which now, ſaith he, cannot be imitated,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:97406:188"/> except perhaps in ſome Republicks, and among thoſe, he ſays, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Venice</hi> is ſo far from imitating the <hi>Romans,</hi> that ſhe reſtrains her Citizens from the Exerciſe of Arms at Land, permitting them only to ſerve in her Naval Militia. In anſwer to this, I think <hi>Lipſius</hi> deals very rudely with Monarchs (himſelf being a ſubject of one of them) who, by his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither have the beſt way of Levy, nor can imitate the beſt way; for he plainly ſays, the <hi>Roman</hi> Levy is the beſt, and cannot be imitated but by ſome Republicks, and not by all of them neither. In the next place I ſay, that though Princes do not bring all their Subjects together in Arms every year, and out of them enrol ſome to be Souldiers, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did, yet it may ſatisfie <hi>Lipſius,</hi> if they do the equivalent; and that is, to order the matter ſo, that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r Subjects on a Frontier be ready in an inſtant to withſtand an invaſion, till the Prince with a greater force comes to repel it: Or if Princes intend to invade others, then by their ſeveral Municipal Laws, they make in a ſhort time ſuch a Levy as ſerves their turn; witneſs the Commiſſion of Array in <hi>England,</hi> the raiſing of all between ſixteen and ſixty in <hi>Scotland;</hi> out of which an Election is quickly made. But <hi>Lipſius</hi> might have remember'd the ſeven Legions which were appointed by <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt to be perpetually maintain'd, and in readineſs, in <hi>France,</hi> in imitation of the <hi>Romans:</hi> Of which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Marſhal <hi>Monluc</hi> writes, that <hi>France</hi> in its Wars found no advantage. So little did that great Captain care for imitating the <hi>Roman</hi> Levy; and if it be true, that <hi>Credendum Artifici in ſuâ arte,</hi> we ſhould in a matter that belongs to War, ſooner truſt <hi>Monluc,</hi> perpetually vers'd in Arms, than <hi>Lipſius,</hi> mew'd up moſt part of his life in a Cell. And if <hi>Lipſius</hi> be offended with the beat of Drum and ſound of Trumpet for our Modern Levies, he ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd, that <hi>Rome</hi> had likewiſe her ſudden and tumultuary Levies. And if he miſlike that Princes and States ſhould give ſuch truſt to ſo great numbers of Strangers as ordinarily they Levy, and keep in Pay, he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the <hi>Romans</hi> truſted their Allies as much, if not more; and after the name of Allies was obliterated, Auxiliaries of ſtrange Nations had the ſame truſt. In the days of our Fathers, and our own too, the Eſtates of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> the Emperour, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> have done great feats by the Levies and maintenance of Strangers.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of the Compariſon conſiſts in the Order kept in their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:<note place="margin">Secondly, in Order.</note> Here he crys out, <hi>O, ille bonus in re Romanâ!</hi> O, how good it was in the <hi>Roman</hi> Milice! But that is not enough, he adds, See the Centurions, the Enſign-bearers, and the Options; here, ſays he, nothing is wanting, nothing redounding. Yes, by your favour, <hi>Lipſius,</hi> I have ſhewn in my Diſcourſes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Milice, there was much wanting. But here our Author ſpeaks not one word of, or againſt the Order of the Modern Militia, and therefore I need not ſpeak one word for it, yet he ſeems to detract from it, by crying up the other ſo much. When he ſpeaks of Officers, he ſeems to ſay the <hi>Romans</hi> had enough of them, and we too many: But if this laſt be true, as perhaps it is, I affirm the <hi>Romans</hi> had too few; for to ſpeak of their Foot, I know not what to make of their Centurions, Sub-Centurions, or Options; but Caporals, Lanceſpeſates, and Bringers-up, as I told you in another place. Nor do I find their Cavalry commanded by any Officers in chief under a Conſul or a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, for the Decurions were not ſubordinate one to another, nor had any of them a greater command than our Corporals or Brigadeers of Horſe. All theſe I look on as Defects, nor hath <hi>Lipſius</hi> prov'd the contrary. In our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Militia there is an order that our Colonels ſhall be with their Regiments and Brigades, and not ſtand in an heap together, as <hi>Lipſius</hi> makes his <hi>Roman</hi> Tribunes to be in time of Battel, all at the Eagle of the firſt Legion, waiting on the Conſul, as his Lackies, or at beſt, as his Adjutants: And this, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, was another defect in the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia, whereof our Modern one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accuſed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He compares the Ancient and Modern Arms, and truly I ſhall eaſily<note place="margin">Thirdly, in Arms.</note> grant that Defenſive Arms were more uſed in <hi>Lipſius</hi> his time, than they are now, &amp; that they were better in more ancient times, than in either his time, or ours. But that will not ſatisfie him, for he will have the <hi>Roman</hi> Weapons, or Defenſive Arms,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:97406:188"/> to be preferr'd to ours. He acknowledgeth the Pike to be an uſeful Weapon,<note place="margin">The Pike.</note> but not ſo good as thoſe Arms the <hi>Romans</hi> had, and for this he cites the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Polybius;</hi> of which I can ſay no more than I have done in my view of that Authors compariſon of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Phalange and the <hi>Roman</hi> Legion, whereof I ſhall repeat nothing in this place. <hi>Lipſius</hi> ſays, A Bow is a more<note place="margin">The Bow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> uſeful Engine of War than an Harquebuſs: I ſhall not add any thing here to what I have ſpoke of the neglect of the Bow; but though I think well of it, I dare not for all that, attribute ſo much to the ſtrength of an Arrow, ſhot by the ſtrongeſt Arm, and moſt experienc'd Archer that ever liv'd, as to a Bullet ſhot out of a Harquebuſs; and yet <hi>Lipſius</hi> attributes full as much, and offers to prove it by ſeveral inſtances taken out of Authors: I pray have the patience to hear them. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> life of <hi>Craſſus</hi> ſays, That the <hi>Parthian</hi> Arrows pierc'd and kill'd through the ſtrongeſt Armour that was ever forg'd on an<note place="margin">Pretty ſtories of Arrows and Archers.</note> Anvil; and <hi>Agathias</hi> tells our Author, That Arrows ſhot by a certain <hi>Goth,</hi> kill'd men through both a Target and a Corſlet. I think this was much, but if you think it not ſo, then hear what follows, If the Arrows ſhot by that dreadful <hi>Goth</hi> fell on Stones or on Rocks, they ſplit and broke them in pieces. If this be true, I wonder why the <hi>Goths</hi> did not rather batter the Walls of Beſieged Towns with Bow and Arrow than with the Ram. But take another ſtory along with you, <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>copius</hi> ſpeaks univerſally of the Archers of his time, that their Arrows could not be reſiſted by either Target or Corſlet, nor by both. To all this I anſwer, firſt, If what theſe Authors ſay be true, then the Ancients made all their Defenſive Arms in vain; for joyn the reports of ſeveral Authors together, you may make this concluſion, That no Head-piece, no Target, no Back nor Breaſt, could reſiſt Arrows, Stones, nay, nor Swords. Secondly I ſay, If Arrows could not be reſiſted with well temper'd Iron or Steel, then it is purely impoſſible to make Armour Musket-proof; and yet that this may be done, and was done in his own time, <hi>Lipſius</hi> knew very well, and this, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is <hi>argumentum ad homine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> Thirdly, I ſay, our Author ſhould have been<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lipſius</hi> too credulous.</note> aſham'd to be ſo credulous as to believe all he read in Hiſtorians, who, no doubt, had theſe tales told them in their own days at the corner of a Chimney, by ſome <hi>Thraſonical</hi> Souldiers, who either ſaid, they did theſe feats themſelves, or avouch'd they ſaw them done by others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lipſius</hi> prefers the Sling (particularly that which is tyed to a Battoon) to our Hand-guns, or Bombards, as he calls them. The Stones or Lead caſt by thoſe Battoon-ſlings, did likewiſe (as our Author avers) break through Corſlets, Targets, and all manner of Armour: And here he crys loud, <hi>Nego, Nego,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Battoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſling.</note> 
                     <hi>Bombardis his noſtris majorem vim eſſe poſſe, fortaſſe nec tantum:</hi> I deny, I deny, ſays he, that Hand-guns can have a greater force, perhaps not ſo great; he adds, <hi>excipio Muſquetta qua vocant:</hi> I except, ſays he, thoſe Guns which they call Muskets. This is all like the reſt of the ſtuff before. But yet he goes a greater length, and tells us gravely, That the Leaden Bullets thrown out of theſe Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toon-ſlings,<note place="margin">An uncouth tale.</note> were caſt with ſuch violent force that they melted by the way; and to let us ſee he is in good earneſt, he offers to prove it by the Authority of both Philoſophers and Poets, as well as Hiſtorians. To the firſt, I ſay, if <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> (for he is the Philoſopher cited) had liv'd in <hi>Lipſius</hi> his time he would have alter'd his opinion, when he ſaw (which <hi>Lipſius</hi> might have ſeen ten thouſand times if he had pleaſed) Bullets ſhot with an incomparable greater force than can be attributed to the Arm of Man, that is, by force of Fire (the violenteſt Agent that nature hath, which melts any Lead; when he ſaw, I ſay, thoſe Bullets batter, break, wound and kill, without being melted. The reaſon given by <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>

Is there any motion ſwifter than that of a Bullet, ſhot from a Gun, and yet that motion (whoſe efficient cauſe is fire) melts not the Lead. It is ſtrange, that <hi>Lipſius</hi> ſhould have believed that which he read more than that which he ſaw.

                     <hi>Lipſius</hi> laughs and ſcoffs at an <hi>Italian</hi> Writer, whom he names not, for ſaying, That he believ'd the ſtrongeſt Arm that ever was, could not throw a ſtone above forty paces, that could do any hurt. I am not of that <hi>Italian</hi>'s opinion, and yet I do not believe with <hi>Lipſius,</hi> that a Slinger could hit a mark with a<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vegetius</hi> his authority</note> Stone ſix hundred real foot. He cites for this the Authority of <hi>Vegetius,</hi> in the twenty third Chapter of his Second Book, where he ſays, That Sheaves of Corn or Graſs were ſet up for the Bow-men and Slingers at ſix hundred foot diſtance, as marks, which they hit often. I believe an Arrow may do it, but that a Battoon-ſlinger can do ſo much, I ſay in our Authors own words, <hi>Nego, Nego.</hi> But I muſt tell you, in this citation of <hi>Vegetius, Lipſius</hi> plays faſt and<note place="margin">Very queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaole in this point.</note> looſe; he knows the firſt part of <hi>Vegetius</hi> his aſſertion is very queſtionable, and that is concerning Bow-men, who, he ſays, were exercis'd by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Romans;</hi> for we find (as in another place I have obſerv'd) in other Authors, that till the time of the Emperours, none of the <hi>Romans</hi> handled a Bow, or any of their Allies either; nor can I find they were uſed by any who ſerv'd for them or with them, till after the <hi>Hannibalick</hi> War: And if <hi>Vegetius</hi> hath err'd in the firſt part of his aſſertion, (as I believe <hi>Lipſius</hi> knew he did) why would the ſame <hi>Lipſius</hi> offer to impoſe on our Faith, as to make us believe that Battoon-ſlingers threw lumps of Lead, and did miſchief with them at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſix hundred foot, eſpecially when the Lead they caſt, was of one pound weight, as the ſame <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſays they were? But let us ſuppoſe all to be true that <hi>Lipſius</hi> reports of the ſix hundred foot, yet it is moſt certain that Musk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>After this, <hi>Lipſius</hi> tells us very ſtoutly, That the noiſe of the Modern Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non<note place="margin">

He ſpeaks this like a Philoſopher, and one that ſate conſtantly in a Cell, and never either ſmelt Powder, or heard a Bullet fly. He avers, the <hi>Romans</hi> would not at all have troubled themſelves with G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns; but who will take <hi>Lipſius</hi> his word for that, when he reads in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hiſtories that they were appall'd, frighten'd, and chac'd out of the Field with Arms and Weapons not ſo terrible by half. And laſtly, he ſhows himſelf ſo much an Admirer of a Sling, that he doth not at all wonder that <hi>David</hi> kill'd <hi>Goliah</hi> with one of them. Nor ſhall I wonder either, if <hi>Lipſius</hi> can aſſure me that the Gyants Helmet did not cover his fore-head; but if it did, (as probably it did) and that his Head-piece was proportionable to the Coat of Mail he had on his Body, (as probably it was) then I ſhall ſay, <hi>David</hi> could<note place="margin">
                        <hi>David</hi> a good Slinger.</note> not kill him with Pebble-ſtones caſt out of a Sling, without a Miracle; for the Stone that could pierce ſuch a Head-piece, requir'd a greater force than <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and twenty of the ſtrongeſt <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were Maſters of; and, no doubt, it was aſſiſted from above.</p>
                  <p>Upon this whole buſineſs of Arms, I think it was well for <hi>Lipſius,</hi> that he was taken up with more grave Studies, that could allow him no time to read Romances; for if the Authors of thoſe had but declared all the acts of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errantry to have been done by the Ancient <hi>Romans, Lipſius</hi> had undoubtedly believ'd them all to be true ſtories. Let us hear what he ſays more, He finds our Modern Artillery good for nothing but for battering the Walls of Towns and Forts; for in Battel, ſays he, any riſing ground, little Bank, or Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, being quickly caſt up, eludes all the hurt Artillery can do. He is ſo far
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:97406:189"/> in the right, that theſe helps (whereof he ſpeaks) are very good, if the Gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ral<note place="margin">

But I think it is very fair, that <hi>Lipſius</hi> is ſo modeſt, that he doth not prefer the Ancient Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pults and Baliſts to the Modern Artillery, and I wonder much he did it hot.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place he brings Embattelling or Marſhalling Armies on the<note place="margin">Fourthly, Embattelling.</note> Stage, and according to his cuſtome, prefers the <hi>Roman,</hi> yet doth not tell us wherein the Modern is deficient; and this is not ſo fair dealing as might have been expected from ſuch a man as <hi>Lipſius.</hi> But I am only to trace him in his own ſteps, and that which he ſaith on this ſubject amounts to this: He firſt ſays, he will let us ſee the <hi>Velites</hi> fight, and retire; in whoſe room he marſhals the <hi>Haſtati,</hi> they being weary, go back; to them ſucceed the <hi>Principes,</hi> who not prevailing, retire; then the <hi>Triarii,</hi> who are, ſaith he, the <hi>Veterans</hi> and the Chieftains, take the work in hand, and they cannot but proſper: yet he who wrote this, cannot but know for all this, that both the <hi>Roman Velites,</hi> their <hi>Haſtati, Principes</hi> and <hi>Triarii,</hi> have been beat out of the Field oftner than once. All theſe things have been already ſufficiently ſpoke of. But I wonder who could tell <hi>Lipſius</hi> that Modern Generals have not their Reſerves, as well as the <hi>Romans</hi> had; ſure in his own time, if he had but enquir'd after it, he might have learn'd that the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> divided their Armies into Van, Battel, and Rear; and what were the <hi>Roman</hi> three fold Batallions but the ſame; and ſince <hi>Lipſius</hi> his time, if great Captains, for good reaſons, have thought they could do their buſineſs better with one Reſerve than with two; I ſuppoſe, <hi>Lipſius,</hi> if he were alive, might acquieſce to it, and not examine their reaſons why they do not tye themſelves to the <hi>Roman</hi> method. But the Jeſt is, <hi>Lipſius</hi> will have a Retreat from one Body to the ſecond, and from<note place="margin">A ridiculous myſtery.</note> that to the third, to be a great ſecret; <hi>Magnum ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

This might be a ſecret to him, and thoſe of his profeſſion, but to no Souldiers; and yet he hath the vanity to deſire all Generals (<hi>Duces</hi> he calls them) to conſider well of his ſecret; but I ſuppoſe, few of them need thank him for revealing ſuch ſecrets. In the next place, he crys up the <hi>Roman</hi> manner of Embattelling, for placing, ſays he, their Cavalry on the Wings or Horns, that their Foot ſhould not be ſurrounded, nor their Battel out-wing'd. What folly was this in him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lipſius</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency.</note> to appropriate that to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was an ordinary cuſtome with other Ancients, it may be, before <hi>Rome</hi> was a City. And it is ſtrange he did not know that it was the cuſtome of all Armies; ſince the downfal of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. But I muſt come nearer him, and ſay, That this was a defect very oft in the <hi>Roman</hi> Militia, to marſhal their Armies ſo that it could not ſave them from being ſurrounded by a numerous Enemy, in regard they drew up ſo many Bodies one behind another; and thoſe Bodies were marſhall'd ſo deep in File, that their Armies could not (eſpecially Conſular Armies) have a large Front; the beſt means in a Champaign, (where there are no advantages of Hills, Rivers, Ditches, or Marſhes to be expected) to ſave an Army from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out-wing'd. When <hi>Lipſius</hi> wrote this, it ſeems he forgot that at <hi>Cannae,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Horſe did ſo little hinder the Foot to be ſurrounded, that the not<note place="margin">Defects in the <hi>Roman</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Embat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling.</note> adverting to it, loſt them the day; for <hi>Aſarubal</hi> having beaten <hi>Aenilius</hi> on the Right Wing, fell on the Rear of the Legions, while they fought in Front with <hi>Hannibal</hi> his Foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and routed them. And if <hi>Lipſius</hi> diſtruſt <hi>Livy</hi> in this relation, let him look on the firſt Book of his own <hi>Polybius,</hi> and there he will find, That <hi>Xantippus</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian,</hi> with an Army of <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> (who had been often beaten and baffled before) and a few Mercenary <hi>Laconians,</hi> routed the <hi>Roman</hi> Army (where the Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this he divides into three parts, Duties, Exerciſes, and Laws. I ſhall trace him in all the three. And firſt, he ſubdivides
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:97406:190"/> Duties into three; theſe are, Private Services to Officers, Watches, and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick<note place="margin">Firſt, Duties, ſubdivided, Private ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> Works. As to the firſt, he ſays, Private Services to Superiours a i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceas'd, or are voluntary. He is right, they are voluntary; yet no Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier now will refuſe to do any honeſt ſervice to his Captain, or any Officer either above or under him; and <hi>Lipſius</hi> knows the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers were no Slaves, and why ſhould Chriſtian Souldiers be Slaves? As to the ſecond part of Duties, which is Watch and Guard, he confeſſeth, there is ſome ſhow of<note place="margin">Watches,</note> them in the Modern Militia not to be contemned; for ſo I interpret his words, which are, <hi>aliqua, nec improba, apud nos ſpecies.</hi> But he adds, <hi>Credo tamen ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua meliora ac tutiora olim fuiſſe:</hi> But I believe, ſays he, that of old ſome things in Watches were better and ſurer: yet I am not obliged to make his belief the ground of my faith, to believe any ſuch thing. And though he tells us not wherein our Modern Guards are defective, yet he ſeems to hint at the <hi>Teſſera,</hi> or Word, at the ſtations before Ports, at the Rounds, and at the diviſion of the Vigils. To all which I anſwer thus: The Modern Words or Signs (when it is needful) are given and received with as much ſecrecy and caution, and with a great deal of leſs trouble than the Ancient <hi>Teſſera</hi> was. Our Rounds in the<note place="margin">Rounds.</note> night, and viſiting the Guards in the day time, are as frequent and as orderly; and the neglect of either them or the Guards, as ſeverely puniſh'd as among either the <hi>Romans</hi> or the <hi>Grecians.</hi> But he ſays, one man ſtanding now at a Port is thought a ſufficient Guard for it; truly, I ſay, he who thinks ſo is a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Souldier; nor can I imagine that ever our Author ſaw in his own Countrey (which in his time was the Stage of <hi>Mars</hi>) a Port guarded only with a Sentinel. It hath been his groſs miſtake, for that Sentinel which he took to<note place="margin">A groſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of <hi>Lipſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
                     </note> be the Guard, ſtood there to challenge Strangers, and upon occaſion to call out the Corporal or whole Watch, who were within a Houſe builded and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for them, commonly called a Court of Guard. As to the Vigils, we have ſometimes Double Sentinels, none whereof ſleeps, none whereof ſits; and if there is but one Sentinel, yet he being viſited not only by the Rounds, but frequently by the Corporal or other Officers, will keep as good, if not better Watch, than four <hi>Romans</hi> on one Poſt, whereof only one ſtood and watch'd the other three lay and ſlept; and were viſited only by the <hi>Circitors,</hi> and not at all by their own Commanders. I know not what he means by the Diviſion of the Vigils, for certainly a Clock, a Paſſelunt, or a Sand-glaſs can divide the hours, and meaſure the night, as well as a <hi>Roman</hi> Water-glaſs.</p>
                  <p>The third kind of Duties, which Souldiers are bound to pay, are Publick<note place="margin">Publick works.</note> Works; and here you may be ſure he will prefer the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers for their wonderful fatigue, to all our Modern Souldiery. And ſo he may, but I will not ſuffer him to calumniate us, and charge us with more idleneſs and ſloth than we are guilty of: For firſt, he avers, That all publick works are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther omitted; he ſays, Souldiers will not lay their hands to a Spade or to a Mattock: They cry out, ſays he, It is a ſhame for a Souldier to meddle with theſe, let others be imployed for ſuch ſervices. It is true, ſuch words have been heard, but very ſoon compeſced. And I verily believe, <hi>Lipſius</hi> had ſuch an animoſity againſt the Modern Militia, that he never either convers'd with Modern Armies, or endeavour'd to learn their cuſtomes; otherwiſe he might have ſeen the contrary of thoſe things he wrote, even at that time when he wrote them. It is a generally receiv'd Maxime, for any thing I know, in all our Modern Armies, That a Souldier is bound to work any thing that can make for<note place="margin">A Souldier is oblig'd to work for his own ſafety.</note> his own Defence; and under that notion, he muſt not refuſe to work in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches before Towns, to make up Breaches, Retrenchments, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-mures within Towns, and to make Sconces, Redouts, and Baſtions, for the Fortification of Camps and Leaguers. If our Author had gone to <hi>Holland</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> he had ſeen his Souldiers work all theſe at the Sieges of <hi>Harlem</hi> and <hi>Leyden;</hi> or nearer to his own Town of <hi>Louvaine,</hi> he might have ſeen the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>'s men work laboriouſly at the Sieges of <hi>Gant, Antwerp,</hi> and many other places; or if he had made a ſtep with that Prince over to <hi>France,</hi> in his two marches thither, he would have ſeen his Souldiers refuſe none of thoſe works I have ſpoke of. Nay, I will tell him that, which will make him inexcuſable, either for Ignorance or Malice, when he wrote this. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiers (and <hi>Lipſius</hi> was the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Subject) thought it a
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:97406:190"/> diſgrace for them to ſuffer Pioneers to work in the Approaches, they would<note place="margin">Cuſtome of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers 80 year ago.</note> do it themſelves, nor would they take Money for their work, for they ſaid they receiv'd the Kings pay for that, as well as for fighting; their cuſtome was to dig in the Approaches with a Helmet and Back-piece, but nothing on their Breaſts and Bellies, becauſe when they bow'd their Bodies to work, only their Heads and Backs were in danger. But if a Prince or a General can eaſe his Souldiers, by the aſſiſtance of Countrey people and Pioneers, will it not be well done? Will they not be the more fit, and the more ready to fight? I ſuppoſe they will. Did not <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Legate, at the Siege of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> make the Country Clowns cut down Trees, bring them to his Camp, and help him in many other Drudgeries; let him read <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Commentaries, and he will find he did ſo.</p>
                  <p>Among thoſe Publick Works he reckons Encamping, and ſo he may juſtly<note place="margin">Encamping.</note> do. And here he fiercely chargeth the men of the Modern Militia with the neglect of both the parts of Encamping, thoſe are, Caſtrametation and Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; and he doth it in a very few words, <hi>Aperte conſidemus, &amp; ſine certo ordine;</hi> we ſit down, ſays he, in our Camps open, and without any regular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I ſhould think that he who wrote this, either was never in a Modern Camp, or did not at all take heed to it. The ſeveral quarters are as orderly divided<note place="margin">Caſtrametati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</note> as ever they were with his <hi>Romans;</hi> for proving which I refer you to my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Modern Caſtrametation; neither will you find ſo many defects in it, as I have obſerved to be in the <hi>Roman,</hi> even as it is deſcrib'd by <hi>Polybius, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duzzi, Preiſſac, Steuechius,</hi> and by <hi>Lipſius</hi> himſelf. As to the Fortification of the Camp, he ſays, we uſe none, except it be a <hi>Waggonburg,</hi> or Sconce of Waggons, whereof I ſpoke formerly, and which he in barbarous <hi>Latin</hi> calls <hi>Carrago.</hi> I ſhall here repeat ſomething (for clearing this matter) of what I ſpoke in another place.

                     </note> and not at all neceſſary, to fortifie their Camps every night, when no Enemy is near them: And when one is near, if they reſolve to fight, they ſtand all night in a fighting poſture; if they do not reſolve to fight, they either retire, or they fortifie. If an Army be to ſtay for one night or two, Generals chuſe ſome high or cloſe piece of ground for Encamping, after the <hi>Grecian</hi> cuſtome; and where it is deficient, they help it by ſome artificial works, or with ſuch a <hi>Carrago</hi> as <hi>Lipſius</hi> ſpeaks of. And I pray you, what neceſſity for fortifying a Leaguer every night, where there is no danger? what good doth it, nay, how much hurt doth it? To make Souldiers work the half of the night to fortifie that Camp (when you are in no danger) which you are to leave the next day betimes. Is this any thing elſe but to give your Souldiers a needleſs fatigue? Hath <hi>Lipſius</hi> never read it, That the juſt man is merciful even to his Beaſt? But in this Diſcourſe our Author is very injurious to thoſe great Captains who were<note place="margin">Both of them ordinary in <hi>Lipſius</hi> his time.</note> coetaneous with him, who were very expert in that point of War, and uſed it more than hath been practiſed ſince. Let any peruſe the Hiſtories of his time, they will find, that at all their Sieges (which were many and frequent) all their Camps were excellently well fortified with a double Circumvallation, one againſt the Beſieged place, and another againſt thoſe without who would attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. If <hi>Lipſius</hi> had liv'd ſome years longer than I ſuppoſe he did, he would have recanted, when he ſaw <hi>Spinola</hi>'s Siege of <hi>Breda</hi> in the year 1625. for there he might have ſeen ſtranger works than ever any he read of; and with which <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Circumvallations either when he beſieg'd <hi>Aleſia,</hi> or when he offer'd to beſiege <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Army at <hi>Dirrachium,</hi> could not compare.

In both which were reckon'd (beſide the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſome Villages, for ſecuring Convoys) above three hundred and ſixty Forts, Batteries, Sconces and Redouts; ſo that he who writes the particular Hiſtory of that famous Siege, hath reaſon to ſay, That there was ſuch a Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of Fortifications there, that none but thoſe who ſaw them will have faith enough to believe it.</p>
                  <p>Our Author tells us here, what a great benefit it was to the <hi>Romans,</hi> to have a Camp to which they might retire after a Battel. But he might have learned, that the great Captains of the Modern Militia propoſe to themſelves no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by theſe Retreats, juſtly fearing their Souldiers may retire before it be
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:97406:191"/> half time, or before they get order for it. And if <hi>Lipſius</hi> had been pleas'd he might have remember'd that his own <hi>Romans</hi> made ſometimes very bad uſe of<note place="margin">A Retreat to a Camp dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</note> retiring to their Camp: As when they run to it from their Enemy in their Mutiny againſt <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> and at other times too; as I have obſerved in my firſt Chapter of the <hi>Roman</hi> Art of War. Nay, ſome of their Conſuls, apprehending the danger of it, took away all poſſibility of retiring to the Camp. Take a few Inſtances. One of the <hi>Fabii,</hi> a Dictator being to fight<note place="margin">Inſtances.</note> with the <hi>Samnites,</hi> caſt down his Entrenchment, burnt his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tents, fought, and gain'd the Victory; as you may ſee it in <hi>Livy</hi>'s Ninth Book. At <hi>Ciminia,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Fabius</hi> cauſed his Drudges in the night-time to caſt down his Ramparts and fill up the Ditch, while he marſhall'd his Army, wherewith he march'd out, and fought next morning with Succeſs. <hi>Cato</hi> the elder being to fight with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> led his Army in the night-time a great circuit, even behind the Enemies Camp, and next morning did ſhew his Souldiers where they were; remonſtrated to them what they had to do, and that there was an impoſſibility to get back to their own Camp, but over the Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

But further, the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate imputed the loſs of <hi>Cannae</hi> to the Retreat of their Army to the Camp, and accordingly puniſh'd all that were taken in the Camp, for that Retreat. And beſides that, take two other Inſtances of the hurt their Retreats to their Camps were like to do: The Conſul <hi>Attilius,</hi> fighting againſt the <hi>Samnites,</hi> ſaw his Foot fly ſhamefully, he inſtantly order'd ſome of his Cavalry to get between them and the Camp, and by meer force drive them back; this was done by the Horſe, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Foot deſperately turning head, gain'd the day; ſee <hi>Livy</hi>'s Ninth Book. At that great Battel which <hi>Lucius Scipio</hi> fought with <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the Left Wing of the <hi>Roman</hi> Foot being indifferently well ſecur'd by a River, the Conſul made his Left Wing of Horſe the weaker; which <hi>Antiochus</hi> perceiving, cauſed a brisk charge to be given on the Horſe, and routed them; and immediately fell on the left Flank of the Foot, who not enduring it, fled toward the Camp; but the Tribune who was left for the defence of it, iſſued with his Cohorts, and forced the flying Legions to face about; which they doing, fought well, and gain'd the day. If this Tribune had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let them enter the Camp, as he might, by <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>'s conſent, have done; in all probability, the reſt of the Legions had left the Field, which, no doubt, had given <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Soveraignty of the greateſt part of <hi>Aſia.</hi>

                     <hi>Lipſius</hi> hath kept us long in the compariſon of the firſt part of Diſcipline, which conſiſts of Duties; now he comes to the ſecond part, which is compos'd (as he will have it) of Trainings and Exerciſings; theſe, he ſays, in the<note place="margin">Exerciſes.</note> Modern Diſcipline are wholly omitted and neglected. In anſwer to which, I ſay, I have ſpoke of great and very great neglects in this point of the Military Art in the later times: But I cannot, I dare not, I will not believe our Author, that they were either neglected or omitted in his days, unleſs I give the lye to all the Hiſtories of thoſe times, which witneſs, That <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> the firſt for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the ſecond for the Eſtates of the <hi>

                  <p>Laſtly, he makes the third part of the Diſcipline of War to conſiſt in Military Laws. And truly, if all be true he ſays, he needs make no compariſon in this point<note place="margin">Military Laws.</note> between the Ancient and Modern Militia; for he avers we have no Laws at all, or very few; or if any at all, they are made in vain, as being never put in execution.

And indeed, thoſe Mutinies which fell out in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armies, after the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Death, and ſome before it, were infamous and inexcuſable; yet no worſe, nor ſo bad by half, as many were among the <hi>Romans;</hi> ſome whereof you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I have obſerved in another place.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. XXIX.</hi> Whether the profeſſion of a Souldier be lawful.</head>
                  <p>WAR being the ſubject of my Military Diſcourſes, and therein I being neceſſitated to ſpeak frequently of Souldiers; becauſe without thoſe, who either truly have, or profeſs to have skill in Military affairs, War cannot be managed, it will be fit to enquire, Whether the profeſſion of a Souldier be lawful; that is, Whether it have any warrant in either Divine or Humane Law, or (which is the ſame) if it be againſt any of them. I do not here intend to queſtion the lawfulneſs of War; for having ſpoke ſomething of that, I ſhall take it for granted, that War grounded on juſtifiable cauſes, is lawful. Nor do I make it a queſtion, Whether Subjects that are able to bear Arms, are bound to ſerve their Princes in the Wars, as Souldiers. But the Quaere ſhall be, Whether it be lawful to make a trade of Souldiery; that is, to learn no other Art, either Liberal or Mechanical, except to ſerve in the Wars for Pay, and thereby to gain a livelihood. The affirmative whereof I maintain, my opinion being grounded on the reaſons mention'd in this following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. But firſt to ſhun cavilling, I ſhall eaſily grant, that it were much more commendable to learn ſome other Art, that when a lawful War is at an end, thoſe who have ſerv'd in it, may work with their hands (as the Apoſtle ſays) and ſo get their livelihood, than to rove from Country to Country to look for imployment in foreign Wars. And without all doubt, many of thoſe who do ſo, cannot but be ſubject to very uncharitable thoughts, and unlawful deſires; for whereas not only Chriſtians, but all men, even as men, ſhould deſire and pray for Peace, as the greateſt Earthly bleſſing mortals can enjoy; thoſe who know not how to get a livelihood in time of Peace, long for War, and wiſh and pray for it; which cannot be done without great ſin both againſt God and Humane Society. But I anſwer, all this is by accident, it is but the wickedneſs of the Souldier, not the profeſſion of Souldiery, that makes him pray for War; for pious and morally honeſt Souldiers in time of Peace may put themſelves in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick ſervice, of either Gentlemen or Country Farmers, and ſo earn their bread, till they have a fair call to follow the Wars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But truly their condition for moſt part is very deplorable, for when they become lame or ſo old that they can ſerve no longer in the Wars, they are good for nothing but Hoſpitals; and becauſe few of them can get into any of theſe, the reſt muſt be contented to beg, as Troops of them do over all Chriſtendome. In ſeveral great Towns of <hi>Germany</hi> I have ſeen Captains begging alms, and at <hi>Bruxels</hi> and <hi>Antwerp</hi> I have known thoſe who could teſtifie by their Paſſes, they had been Lieutenant-Colonels and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jors; much more others of a lower degree begging Charity in the Streets.</p>
                  <p>But I find nothing that occurs to my memory, either in the Old or New Teſtament, that diſchargeth the profeſſion of Souldiery, that is, to ſerve for Pay in the Wars, whether theſe Souldiers have learn'd any other trade or not; yea, on the contrary, there be ſeveral paſſages that confirm me in my opinion. I ſhall not inſtance <hi>Abner, Joab, Amaſa, Benajah,</hi> and others, who were meer<note place="margin">Prov'd to be lawful.</note> Souldiers, and manag'd the Wars of <hi>Saul, Iſhboſheth, David</hi> and <hi>Solomon;</hi> for it may be told me, theſe were Gentlemen, who had Eſtates, and needed learn no other Trade: but I ſhall ſay, That <hi>Jephte</hi> had no Eſtate, having been ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd from his patrimony by his Brethren, becauſe he was a Baſtard: He, I ſay, knew no other trade but Souldiery, and thereby maintain'd himſelf and his followers, and in the Land of <hi>Tob</hi> he learn'd and practis'd his Art of Souldie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo happily againſt the Enemies of Gods people (for ſo <hi>Deodati</hi> interprets it) that his Countrey-men by a ſolemn Embaſſie, invited him to be their Captain General againſt the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> which he accepted, and wrought their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:97406:192"/> Here have you a Souldier, who knew no other Art or profeſſion but that of Souldiery, approved of by the Lord, and elected by him and the people at <hi>Miſpa,</hi> to fight the Lords Battels againſt the Enemies of his people; and this very Souldier is reckon'd among the elect and faithful, by the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. 2. v. 32. In the Goſpel we read that the Souldiers ask'd the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> what they ſhould do to he ſav'd: <hi>Be contented with your wages,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and do violence to no man.</hi> Here he bids them not learn other trades, and I am bound to believe, that moſt of thoſe who ask'd him the queſtion, if not all of them, were <hi>Romans,</hi> who knew no other liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood but to be Souldiers, and were then quarter'd in <hi>Judea,</hi> to keep the <hi>Jews</hi> under the ſubjection of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours; and whether this was a lawful employment or not, ſhall be ſpoke to hereafter. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> moves the queſtion, Who goes to War on his own charges? meaning none is bound to do it. Hence it will follow, that a Souldier may ſerve for wages; or if any will ſerve without wages, as ſome Volunteers do, it is not forbidden them; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in theſe two places, nothing being ſpoke againſt the profeſſion of Souldiery, I may ſafely conclude, that the profeſſion of a Souldier, without any other trade, is allow'd and authoriz'd by thoſe two great Saints. Our bleſſed Lord bore witneſs, That the Centurion who ſaid he was not worthy that our Saviour ſhould come under his roof, had more Faith than he had found in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and I make no doubt, but if the profeſſion of Souldiery had been unlawful, he would have bid him learn ſome other Art wherewith to gain his livelihood. The like may be ſaid of that Centurion, who ſent to <hi>Joppa</hi> for St. <hi>Peter</hi> to come to <hi>Caeſarea;</hi> for we find not that the Apoſtle, when he inſtructed that Captain and his Friends of the means of their Salvation, gave him either advice or command to learn any other trade than that of Souldiery; and it may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be probably conjectured, but aſſerted, that theſe two Centurions had learn'd no other trade but that of Souldiery; as much may be ſaid of a third Centurion, who confeſs'd our Saviour to be the Son of God, even when he ſaw him ſuffer on the Croſs as a Man, who, as Church Hiſtories mention, dyed a Martyr for the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
                  <p>Theſe of whom I ſpeak, who know no Art or way of livelihood but by the trade of Souldiery, are ordinarily called, <hi>Souldiers of Fortune;</hi> though moſt of them might rather be call'd the <hi>Sons of Misfortune.</hi> From what I have ſaid, this argument may be fram'd, that That Profeſſion, Art, or Trade, that is neither directly, indirectly, or conſequentially condemned by any Divine Law or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, mention'd in Holy Scripture, is in it ſelf lawful; but the Profeſſion or Art of Souldiery, without any relation to any other Art, is neither direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, indirectly, nor conſequentially diſcharged in Scripture: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the profeſſion of meer Souldiery is lawful. If it be objected here, That the Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> orders every man that would eat, to work with his hands: I anſwer firſt, That the <hi>Corinthians</hi> being a people conquer'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> were not permitted to be Souldiers; and next, if the command be general for all Nations, and in all Ages, then Souldiers are included, for they work with their hands, and very oft a bloody work. And if no Divine Law be againſt this profeſſion, as little can it be alledged, That any poſitive Law of man hath forbid it; and daily experience teaches us, That all Princes and States make uſe of men who know no other trade but that of Souldiery; which they could not do without ſin, if that profeſſion were unlawful in it ſelf. Nay, I have known the time, thirty years ago, when I ſerv'd in <hi>Germany,</hi> That Princes and States, though they beſtow'd Levy-ſhoney very plentifully, could not get half ſo many of that profeſſion as they deſired; and at this very time when I write this, thoſe <hi>European</hi> Princes who are hot in War with others, cannot get men enough of that trade; and yet I ſhall eaſily grant, they get more than they pay well.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Hugh de Grot,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Grotius,</hi> a very learned and grave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Grotius</hi>'s opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> towards the end of the Twenty fifth Chapter of his Second Book <hi>De fare Belli ac Pacis,</hi> is a heavy Enemy to the trade of Souldiery; for there he ſays, <hi>Nullum vitae genus eſt improbius, quam eorum, qui ſine cauſa reſpectu, mercede con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducti, militant:</hi> No kind of life (ſays he) is ſo godleſs as of thoſe, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to the cauſe, fight for wages; and he ſubjoyns, <hi>Et quibus ibifas, ubi plurima merces:</hi> And with whom it is a Rule, That War is moſt lawful, where
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:97406:193"/> greateſt Pay is to be got. For anſwer, What if I grant all this, it will make juſt nothing againſt my aſſertion: The abuſe of a thing cannot make the thing unlawful; I ſhall confeſs it is ſo as he ſays, with very many Souldiers, who have another falſe Maxime (which <hi>De Grot</hi> mentions not) and that is, It is all one with them whom they ſerve, ſo they ſerve faithfully. Theſe are great faults in too many Souldiers, but all Souldiers not being guilty of them, all ſhould not be charged with them; nor ſhould the profeſſion ſuffer for the fault of ſome of its profeſſors. <hi>De Grot</hi> would have taken it unkindly, if I ſhould have argued thus with him, No ſuch a Godleſs kind of life, as of thoſe, who without any regard to the juſtice of the cauſe, embrace the quarrels, though never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, of ſuch Clients who are beſt able to reward them; for though this be true enough in <hi>theſi,</hi> yet <hi>Grotius</hi> would have thought, that by ſuch an expreſſion, I reflected on all Lawyers and Advocates, and their profeſſion too; for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that too many Lawyers do ſo, which <hi>Grotius</hi> (who profeſs'd Law) knew but too well, and perhaps practis'd it too much. And as <hi>Grotius</hi> muſt confeſs, that it is a ſin in an Advocate to plead for a Fee in a Clients cauſe, which he knows to be unjuſt; ſo I ſhall acknowledge all Souldiers to be ſinners who fight in a cauſe which they know to be unjuſt. But I muſt tell you, there is a great difference between Souldiers and Lawyers in this caſe, for there be but few Advocates <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ho cannot diſcern between the juſtice and unjuſtice of the cauſe they undertake to defend; whereas on the other hand, there be but few, and very few Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who can diſcern between a juſt and an unjuſt cauſe, for which they are to fight. I knew a perſon abroad, who left an Honourable employment, in which he had gain'd much reputation, and went to his own Countrey to commence a War againſt his Prince; for being illiterate, he was not able to diſcern that he was fighting againſt Gods Ordinances, when he ſuffer'd himſelf to be perſwaded by ſome skilful and learned men, that he was to fight for the cauſe of God.</p>
                  <p>That Souldier who ſerves or fights for any Prince or State, for wages, in a cauſe he knows to be unjuſt, ſins damnably, and ſtands in need of both a ſudden and ſerious repentance. But alas, how few of them can diſcern; and again, alas, how few of them ſtudy to diſcern, and inform themſelves of the Juſtice or Unju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of a cauſe! Beſides, it is the ſad fate of many of them, that being engaged in a foreign Prince's ſervice, even in a juſt cauſe; when that War is at an end, the Prince begins a new War, and an unjuſt one, but will not permit his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to leave his ſervice, as being tyed to him by their Military Sacrament; yet I think, if foreign Souldiers knew the War to be unjuſt, in ſuch a caſe they ſhould deſert their employments, and ſuffer any thing that can be done to them, before they draw their Swords, againſt their own Conſciences and Judgements, in an unjuſt quarrel.</p>

It were to be wiſh'd, that War might be ended, and an Enemy overcome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out killing; for a bloodleſs Victory is the moſt honourable: But if that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done, it is folly, nay, madneſs, to ſay that Souldiers ſhould not kill their Enemies. I confeſs, too many Souldiers are cruel in putting to death thoſe whom they might ſpare, as ſuch who yield themſelves Priſoners, (and yet this many times in the heat and ardour of Battel cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger) or old people, Women, Children, in aſſaults and ſtorms; this is the Souldiers exceſs, this is their fault, this is their crime, (unleſs they be commanded to do it, which ſeldome falls out;) but this ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the profeſſion of Souldiery, as <hi>Grotius</hi> makes it to do, ſince by the Law of Arms, ſuch peoples lives ſhould be ſpared; the faults of ſome ſhould
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:97406:195"/> not be imputed to all, as <hi>Grotius</hi> does here, and therein he is moſt unjuſt. I ask, If ſome Lawyers, by colluſion with the contrary party, betray the cauſe of their Clients; If ſome Phyſicians poyſon their Patients; and ſome Paſtors of Churches, by preaching Hereſie and Schiſm, kill their Flocks? Muſt all Lawyers be called Knaves and Cheats? all Phyſicians Poyſoners? and all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel Soul Murderers? God forbid. I confeſs, when Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers kill without cauſe, they are more deteſtable than Hangmen, and deſerve to be puniſh'd by the hands of Hangmen; but <hi>Grotius</hi> was bound in reaſon to have limited his expreſſion, and not have extended it to all Souldiers, as his words bear; and herein he is not only malicious, but ridiculous, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that Souldiers always kill without cauſe, and never with cauſe; for if this be true, all War is unlawful, which <hi>Grotius</hi> durſt never mutter, far leſs ſpeak out; for in a lawful War, Souldiers kill with cauſe, and when they do it without cauſe, they are liable to puniſhment and cenſure. This unlimited and general expreſſion of <hi>Grotius,</hi> renders <hi>Moſes, Joſhuah,</hi> and all thoſe famous <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who deſtroy'd the <hi>Canaanites; Saul, Samuel,</hi> and others who put the <hi>Amalekites</hi> to the Sword; <hi>David</hi> and his Worthies, who killed thouſands and ten thouſands of the uncircumciſed, and <hi>Joab</hi> who killed ſo many <hi>Iſrrelites</hi> in <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Rebellion, and all thoſe of the eleven Tribes who had well near ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin: Grotius,</hi> I ſay, makes them all more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>able than Hangmen. And what is it to the purpoſe to tell us, <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> ſaid, That Tyrants are not ſo pious as Hangmen, becauſe the laſt puts only the guilty, the firſt the innocent to death. What hath that to do with the profeſſion of a Souldier, of which <hi>De Grot</hi> was ſpeaking: As ſure as all Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants are not Souldiers, as certain it is that all Souldiers are not Tyrants. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this great man ſuppoſeth in his compariſon, that which is a manifeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, That Hangmen put none to death but thoſe who are guilty; certainly <hi>Grotius</hi> did know that moſt, if not all thoſe Innocents, againſt whom Tyrants have pronounced the Sentence of Death, eſpecially in the ten firſt Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were executed by the hands of bloody and cruel Hang-men, whom <hi>De Grot</hi> with a ſtrange and odd kind of Charity, prefers before Souldiers. I doubt <hi>Grotius</hi> did not believe, that the Hang-man that beheaded <hi>Olden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernevelt,</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> with whom <hi>Grotius</hi> was <hi>Socius Criminis,</hi> ſtruck off the Head of a guilty man, for aſſuredly he thought him an Innocent.</p>
                  <p>I am afraid <hi>De Grot</hi> wrote this (though it came not to light till ſix years after) when he was Priſoner at <hi>Lovenſtein,</hi> beſide <hi>Gorcum;</hi> where he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a mortal hatred againſt Souldiers, perhaps becauſe they guarded him too ſeverely. His comparing Souldiers to Hangmen may have proceeded from the reſtleſs agitations of his troubled thoughts, which may have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually repreſented to his fancy the Idaea or Image of one of thoſe Officers of Juſtice, who had cut off the Head of his Complice <hi>John Oldenbernevelt,</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate of <hi>Holland,</hi> and would have done as much to another of his Complices, <hi>Giles Leidenberg,</hi> if he had not uſurp'd the Hangmans Office, and cut his own Throat; it being moſt certain, that <hi>Grotius</hi> himſelf might have run ſuch a hazzard, if his kind Wife had not got him carried away in a Coffer, pretending it was full of Books, and at that time ſure he was oblig'd to Souldiers for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to ſearch the Coffer.</p>

Well, I ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to take what he grants, and that is, That War ſometimes is honeſt; and if ſo, I think he muſt grant, that thoſe who manage that honeſt War, and thoſe are Souldiers, may be ſometimes honeſt, and therefore not more deteſtable than Hangmen. Nor do I think any ſober man, endued with any reaſonable proportion of ſolid Judgement, though he had never heard of the name of Jeſus Chriſt, but will readily grant, That War being the greateſt ſcourge of mankind, ſhould not be begun till either our own extreme neceſſity, or the Love and Charity we owe to our Neighbours force us to
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:97406:195"/> it; and herein do all the Moral Philoſophers, and the wiſe Rulers of the Ancient Heathens, fully agree with Chriſtian Doctors. But how ſhall that War, which either extreme neceſſity on our own part, or Charity on our Neighbours, makes lawful, be managed but by Souldiers? And how can Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers obtain the Victory, but by killing ſometimes their Enemies? And with what Credit, nay, with what Conſcience, or with what comfort can Souldiers kill their Enemies, if the very killing them, render Souldiers more deteſtable than Hangmen? If <hi>Grotius</hi> had ſaid, That thoſe Souldiers who kill'd impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent old Men, Women and Children, or Priſoners in cold blood (as too many do) are more deteſtable than Hangmen, I ſhould never have debated the matter with him, no more than with reaſon he can contradict me, if I ſay, That thoſe Advocates (and <hi>Grotius</hi> was an Advocate) who betray the cauſes of their Clients, who take money and wages from both parties; I add alſo, Thoſe who undertake the patrociny of a cauſe, which themſelves know to be unjuſt and illegal, are more deteſtable than the worſt of thoſe who hang men on a Gallows.</p>

                     <hi>artificia Bellum,</hi> I do not very well know; if he means there are no artifices in War, he makes a fool of himſelf, for what ſhall then become of all thoſe laudable and lawful Stratagems that are uſed in War, which he himſelf in his Book <hi>De Jure Belli ac pacis,</hi> both mentions and commends: If he means War is not an Art, he ſpeaks palpably againſt Senſe, Reaſon, and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for the management of War is an Art, and as a moſt noble, ſo a moſt neceſſary Art: <hi>Machiavelli,</hi> Recorder of <hi>Florence,</hi> writes ſeven Books of the Art of War, and yet in one of them denies War to be an Art. All Tacticks write of the Art of War, the way to handle Arms, Sword, Dagger, Cannon, Musket, Piſtol, Pike, Partizan, or Halberd; or in more ancient times (before the Monk found out Gun-powder) the way to handle the <hi>Roman Pila,</hi> Javelines, Darts, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, Bows, Slings, Stones, and other Miſſiles; do all prove there is Art in War. The ordering Souldiers in Files, Ranks, Troops, Companies, Squadrons, Batallions, Regiments, and Brigades; the marſhalling and conduct of Armies, fighting of Battels, beſieging and attacking Towns, Caſtles, and defending them, do all bear witneſs, that War is an Art, and more than an ordinary one: It cannot therefore be, that ſo wiſe a man as <hi>Grotius</hi> could think that War is not an Art, but poſitively to tell what he means by thoſe words, is not in my power; and if others can tell no better than I, we muſt be content to want the true ſenſe of them, till <hi>Grotius</hi> riſe from the dead in the day of Judgement; and then, I ſuppoſe, it will not be time to inquire after ſuch follies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nicholas Machiavel</hi> in the Fourth Book of his Art of War (if I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Machiavelli</hi> anſwered.</note> right) is yet more ſevere to profeſs'd Souldiers than <hi>Hugo Grotius;</hi> for he ſays, That no Prince or State ſhould ſuffer thoſe who profeſs to live by the Art of War, to dwell under their Jurisdictions, or in their Dominions. This is bad enough, but worſe follows, for he adds, that no virtuous nor good man will profeſs Souldiery to be their livelihood, or uſe War as an Art or Trade; and thoſe who do it, ſays he, muſt of neceſſity be falſe, fraudulent, treacherous and violent. I have anſwered his Raveries in the firſt Chapter of my Military Eſſays of the Modern Art of War: Here I ſhall only ſay, That it were a diſgrace for the Art of Souldiery to be commended by one, whoſe Political Rules introduce Atheiſm, Tyranny, and Cruelty; and who ſets up <hi>Caſar Borgia,</hi> the Baſtard of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth, to be a Pattern for Princes; than whom the Sun never look'd on a perſon more abandon'd to the contempt of a Deity, guilty of Inhumanity, Treachery, Lechery, and barbarous Cruelty. Let either Chriſtian or all Morally honeſt men judge, whether this Author, this Atheiſt, this <hi>Machiavel,</hi> ſhould have been permitted to have liv'd within the Territories of either Chriſtian Prince or State.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who condemn the Profeſſion or Art of Souldiery, ſmell rank of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm and Quakery, both which Sects condemn all War as unlawful; for I conceive, thoſe who grant War to be ſometimes both lawful and neceſſary, muſt of neceſſity grant, that it is lawful for ſome to ſtudy the Art, how to
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:97406:196"/> manage that War with the greateſt advantage. Thoſe who are fitteſt to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it are thoſe who have no other trade or livelihood, for that is the mean to make them ſtudy it the more accurately; and when they have attain'd to ſome perfection in it, why they may not make a Profeſſion of it, and teach it to others for wages, I know not: Do not all profeſſors of Divinity, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, Philoſophy, teach others their Arts and Sciences for wages? Yes aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and why ſhould it be denied to a profeſſed Souldier to teach his Art to others for wages, <hi>Muſamihi cauſas memora:</hi> What I ſpeak of teaching others, I mean of all Military Officers, who by their command and charges are oblig'd to teach their Art to thoſe under their command; and ſince Souldiery is a practical Art, Souldiers of all kinds may ſerve in the Wars (provided the cauſe ſeem juſt to them) as well as Chirurgions may cure men for wages, that are hurt or wounded in the Wars. Hiſtories tell us, and our experience and ſence teach us, That Peace and War are alternative, and there be but few Kingdoms in the World that have not felt the ſmart of War, as long as they have enjoyed the fruits of Peace. May not I then conclude, That the Art of Souldiery and the Profeſſion of it for wages, is as lawful, and as neceſſary too, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of any of thoſe Arts or Sciences, which can neither be conveniently taught, or learn'd, but in the time of Peace.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude, I avouch that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s opinion concerning this queſtion<note place="margin">St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</note> was the ſame with mine; and I have reaſon to think, That great Apoſtle's authority will weigh more with men who profeſs the name of Chriſt, than either <hi>Grotius</hi> or <hi>Machiavel:</hi> If I miſtake not, that great Doctor of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> thought the Art of Souldiery, conſider'd a part, and diſtinguiſh'd from all other Arts, either Liberal or Mechanical, very lawful, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd not the profeſſors of it to infamous people, ſuch as <hi>Grotius</hi> knew Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be. On the contrary, the Apoſtle propoſes a pure Souldier, who waited only on his own Art of War, as a fit example for his Son <hi>Timothy</hi> to follow: Read the third and fourth verſes of the ſecond Chapter of his Second Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> you will find theſe words, <hi>Thou therefore endure hardneſs, at a good Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt. No man that Warreth, entangleth himſelf with the things of this life, that he might pleaſe him who hath hired him to be a Souldier.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Tranſlation hath it, <hi>the affairs of this life;</hi> the <hi>Italian, the doings of this life;</hi> the <hi>German</hi> hath it, <hi>no Warriour ſeeks another livelihood.</hi> This is much, and more than I deſire; for, I think, it were good for Souldiers to have learned ſome othe Art, or Trade, than that of Souldiery only. <hi>Deodati</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds theſe words [<hi>in the doings of this life;</hi>] that is, ſays he, in ſuch affairs, ſuch Art, or ſuch Trades, as may hinder a Souldier in his duty of Souldiery. Be that as it will, I avouch, That the Apoſtle in theſe words, pronounceth the pure Art of a meer Souldier, without any other Art or Trade, to be moſt lawful, elſe he had made no appoſite compariſon between <hi>Timothy</hi> and a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; which, I preſume, none who hath read <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, and believes them to be endited by the Holy Ghoſt, will be ſo impious as to fancy. By this Text, a Chriſtian man may very lawfully apply himſelf to the profeſſion of pure Souldiery, without learning any other Art or Trade. And I think alſo, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was exhorted, if not commanded to apply himſelf only to the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and to no other Art; yet if he had learn'd any other way of livelihood, before <hi>Paul</hi> circumcis'd him, it would not have been forbid him: <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, before his converſion, had learn'd to be a Tent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, which he exercis'd for his livelihood, when he preach'd the Goſpel: <hi>Luke</hi> the Evangeliſt, before his Baptiſm, was a Phyſician, which, no doubt, he practis'd all the time he accompanied St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Voyages. But, I think, by this Text, men are forbid to learn any other Art, after they are actual Miniſters of the Goſpel. And therefore, I conceive, Church-men are forbid to have plurality of Profeſſions; which perhaps they will be contented to hear with better will, than to have it told them, That plurality of Benefices is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the Clergy.</p>

This is more than I have yet ſaid, this great and pious Divine ſeems to me to aſſert, That a Souldiers Art is not only lawful, but that he is bound to fight when commanded, even in a cauſe, the Juſtice whereof does not appear to him; yea, though the Injuſtice of it be made apparent to him. But aſſuredly St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> meant to except thoſe things which are diametrically againſt the word and Will of God; for the rule holds firm and perpetual, Better obey God than Man: In other matters, the Souldier is not ſo ſtrictly to examine the quarrel, the ſin of commanding to fight in an unjuſt cauſe, rendering the Souldiers obedience in fighting, blameleſs and innocent. Hence it will follow, That a profeſs'd Souldier, who knows no other Art or Trade, may lawfully make profeſſion of his skill, and practiſe it in any part of the World for wages, ſo he fight not for thoſe who are profeſs'd Enemies of the name of Chriſt, againſt thoſe who profeſs it; for I do not at all doubt, but Chriſtian Souldiers, who make a profeſſion of Souldiery, and have no other way of livelihood but to fight for wages, may very lawfully ſerve either the Sophi of <hi>Perſia,</hi> or the great Mogul of <hi>India,</hi> againſt the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though they be all three equally blaſphemous adorers of the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> yet the Wars of the firſt two may divert the Grand Signior from the Invaſion of Chriſtendome.</p>

I doubt not, but the War which the Tyrant <hi>Maximianus</hi> made, was neither juſt nor lawful, yet the <hi>Theban</hi> Legion, conſiſting of ſix thouſand Chriſtians, ſerv'd faithfully in that War, and found no oppoſition in their Conſciences to that Military employment: But when that Pagan Emperour commanded them to Sacrifice to his falſe Deities and Idols, then they flatly refus'd obedience, knowing ſurely they were not oblig'd to diſobey God, by giving obedience to Man; and offer'd their Throats to be cut, and gave their Bodies to be butcher'd to death by the reſt of his Heathen Army. <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, who with both force and fraud, endeavour'd to root out the Chriſtian Name and Religion, had thouſands of Chriſtians who ſerved under him in his Wars, who, I ſuppoſe, never examin'd the Juſtice of them; for if they had, they would have found that even that very War he made againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> (wherein he dyed, as is ſaid, blaſpheming the name of the Son of God) was grounded only on Ambition to enlarge the limits of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and ſuch a reaſon even the moral Heathen, much leſs the Chriſtians, did never
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:97406:197"/> acknowledge to be a juſt or lawful cauſe of War. By vertue then of theſe paſſages and precedents, Souldiers may make a profeſſion of the Art of War, and may practiſe it, and ſerve for Wages, though they neither know nor examine, whether the cauſe be juſt or not. But I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this diſcourſe, as they ſay <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did one of his, but in another caſe, and ſay, It is moſt ſafe to truſt to the Juſtice and Equity of the cauſe, and to examine it well, before men engage in it.</p>
